Mr. Pullman replied that the account was covered with remarks in the handwriting of M r. Clensenti. There was also one remark in w i tness 's own handwriting. When the depositions had been completed, Mr. Campbell, the solicitor concerned for the Loneon and D u bli n Bank, applied to have the bill given into hi s possession, as he had only parted with on the understanding that it would be returned to when the evidence was closed. It was indispenible to have the bill i n the proceedings now pending he'aalf of the London and Dublin Bank. Mr. Humphrey objected to the bill being given up bill had been made part of the evidence in a case prosecution by the Queen, and therefore it must remain in the custody of the proper officers. Mr. BINGUAM said, the solicitor was under a wrong impret.sion about any un d (rttanding that the bill wou!,l be given back to him. Nothing of the sort toa place. The bill would be kept in safe custody, bu' would be forthcoming fur the purposes of the olit:itt , r whenever it might be required. Mr. Campbell sail, in a recent case &different deci.,ion had been arrived at. Mr. BINGRAM said, the case referred to was one of misd , meancur only. The present was a case of felony, and that made all the difference. The witnesses were then bound over to prosecute. The second charge, for fraudulently obtainin g th ree bills for 7501. from Lieutenant: Garland, was about to be called on, when Mr. Ballantine rose and said, his client wished the case to be further adjourned, in order to give him further time to consult with his friends, and prepare his answer to the charge. PUBLICITY TO CASES UNDER TUB INSOLVENT PROTECTION ACT.—Complaints have been made on the part of persons who have petitioned under the Protection Act, that their names appear in the newspapers as applicants four times within the year. In the cases referred to, proposals have long been made to pay the creditors by quarterly instalments; and protection being granted for three months at a time, the cases have hitherto appeared in the printed lists. In order to obviate the nocessity of so much publicity, it has been suggested that if the quarterly payments are made about a week before the date of the protection, the names need not appear in print. There are a great many insolvents, especially Government clerks, who will gladly avail themselves of the regulAtion, and escape appearing before the public. The payments must be wide before the lists of the wee , k are print, d. The subject has been ral times before the Cutnmissioners, and they have expressed their willingness to adopt a plan to avoid frequ. nt notice of cases, provide d no harm was done to creditors. Persons who were anxious to pay their creditors were not to be placed in a worse position than those applicants who made no proposals to pay their debts. PROVIDENTIAL. ESCAPE.--OD Monday evening, a gig belonging to Mr. Reynolds, of Truro, was at Chacewater, with his son in it (a lad ten years of age), when a carriage returning from the west, and coming down the village rather fast, came in contact with the wheel of the gig, and turned the vehicle completely bottom upwards, with the child underneath; strangely, however, neither the child, horse, nor gig were injured.— West Briton.
