            "New Delhi A judge in southern India has ruled a woman wore \"provocative\" clothing, effectively dismissing her sexual assault complaint, causing public outcry in the country, where violence against women and girls make frequent headlines.",
            "The district court judge in Kerala state made the comments last week while granting anticipatory bail to a 74-year-old man accused of sexual harassment and assault, according to court documents. He had not been formally charged.",
            "Photographs produced with the man's bail application show the woman wearing \"sexual (sic) provocative\" dresses, the court order said, adding that based on the court's first impression her complaint would \"not ... stand\" against the accused.",
            "It was also \"impossible to believe\" the disabled man could \"forcefully\" pull the woman into his lap and \"sexually press her breast,\" the court order said.",
            "CNN reached out to the man's lawyer, but had not heard back at the time of publishing.",
            "The news sparked outrage in India, where women face widespread discrimination and allegations of sexual assault often go underreported due to the lack of legal recourse and a notoriously slow legal system.",
            "The chairperson of Delhi's Commission for Women, Swati Maliwal, condemned the district judge and urged Kerala's High Court to take up the case.",
            "\"When will the mindset that blames victims of sexual abuse change?\" she tweeted Wednesday.",
            "V. P. Sanu, president of the Students' Federation of India, called the judge's comments \"regressive.\" \"The logic women invite sexual assault for their dress is both victim blaming & invoking rape-victim stereotypes,\" he wrote on Twitter Wednesday.",
            "India's sexual assault problem",
            "Sexual crimes against women are widespread in India, but brutal cases of rape and assault are often dealt with poorly under the country's justice system.",
            "In 2017, a Delhi High Court judge said a man deserved \"the benefit of the doubt\" while acquitting him on rape charges, adding a \"feeble 'no'\" could still signal willingness on the part of an alleged victim.",
            "In another case in January 2021, a Bombay High Court Judge found that a 39-year-old man was not guilty of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl as he had not removed her clothes, meaning there was no skin-on-skin contact.",
            "\"Considering the stringent nature of punishment provided for the offense, in the opinion of this court, stricter proof and serious allegations are required,\" the judge said.",
            "Legal reforms and more severe penalties for rape were introduced following the brutal 2012 gang-rape of a medical student in Delhi -- including fast track courts to move rape cases through the justice system swiftly and an amended definition of rape to include anal and oral penetration.",
            "But activists and lawyers say more should be done to protect women.",
            "On Monday, 11 men jailed for life for the gang-rape of a pregnant Muslim woman during Hindu-Muslim riots in 2002 were freed on remission, drawing condemnation from the victim's family, lawyers and politicians."

It happened when we took over power in 2015: There were lots of blocked funds, about $600 million at that time. It was at a time when the country was in a recession and there were dwindling revenues coming to the country, yet we honored our obligation to pay out all those blocked funds,\" Sirika told CNN Thursday.",

            "The local currency has been in freefall against the dollar with most of the country's foreign exchange derived from crude oil sale, which has dwindled due to oil theft in producing communities. The government is also burdened with the high cost of subsidizing fuel for local consumption.",

            "The threat of nuclear calamity has hung for months over Russia's war in Ukraine.",
            "Those fears were renewed last week after shelling intensified around the massive Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, which has been under Russian control since March.",
            "Attacks at the complex, which have ramped up as fighting flares in Ukraine's south, have sparked concerns about the specter of nuclear disaster, leading the United Nation's watchdog and world leaders to demand that a mission be allowed to visit the site and assess the damage.",
            "So just how real is the risk that the fighting poses?",
            "Nuclear experts are keen to defuse some of the more alarmist warnings, explaining that the main threat is closest to the plant itself and doesn't justify Europe-wide alerts. Experts are particularly wary of any comparisons to the Chernobyl disaster, a repeat of which is incredibly unlikely, they said.",
            "\"It's not very likely that this plant will be damaged,\" Leon Cizelj, president of the European Nuclear Society, told CNN. \"In the very unlikely case that it is, the radioactive problem would mostly affect Ukrainians that live nearby,\" rather than spreading throughout eastern Europe as was the case with Chernobyl, he said.",
            "\"If we used past experience, Fukushima could be a comparison of the worst-case scenario,\" Cizelj added, referring to the serious but more localized meltdown at the Japanese plant in 2011. The most pressing dangers would be faced by Ukrainians living in the vicinity of the plant, which is on the banks of the Dnipro River, south of Zaporizhzhia city, and by the Ukrainian staff who are still working there.",
            "Here's what you need to know about the clashes at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, and what their implications could be.",
            "What's happening at the Zaporizhzhia plant?",
            "Shellfire at the Zaporizhzhia plant in recent weeks has damaged a dry storage facility -- where casks of spent nuclear fuel are kept at the plant -- as well as radiation monitoring detectors, according to Energoatom, Ukraine's state-run nuclear power company.",
            "On August 5, several explosions near the electrical switchboard caused a power shutdown and one reactor was disconnected from the electrical grid, the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief said.",
            "Rafael Mariano Grossi told the UN Security Council that the situation had deteriorated \"to the point of being very alarming.\"",
            "Kyiv has repeatedly accused Russian forces of storing heavy weaponry inside the complex and using it as cover to launch attacks, knowing that Ukraine can't return fire without risking hitting one of the plant's six reactors. Moscow, meanwhile, has claimed Ukrainian troops are targeting the site. Both sides have tried to point the finger at the other for threatening nuclear terrorism.",
            "Calls are growing for an IAEA mission to be allowed to visit the complex. But fighting has continued despite the concern.",
            "On Tuesday, Ukrainian authorities said the town of Nikopol, across the Dnipro River from the plant, had again come under rocket fire again.",
            "\"The shelling has threatened the safety of operators working on the site, and there have been reports that a worker was hit by shrapnel and taken to hospital,\" Henry Preston, a communications manager at the London-based World Nuclear Association, told CNN.",
            "He called the workers' professionalism under occupation \"remarkable\" and the use of an operational power plant for military activities \"unconscionable.\"",
            "How secure are the plant's nuclear reactors?",
            "Modern nuclear power plants are extremely well reinforced to prevent damage from all kinds of attacks, such as earthquakes, and Zaporizhzhia is no exception.",
            "\"Like all nuclear power plants, Zaporizhzhia contains various redundant safety systems, which under normal circumstances are highly effective,\" James Acton, the co\u2011director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN.",
            "\"The problem is that nuclear power plants are not designed for war zones and, under plausible circumstances, all these systems could fail,\" he added.",
            "The plant's six reactors -- only two of which are currently functioning -- are protected by steel and meters-thick concrete casing. \"Random shelling cannot really destroy this, it would be really improbable,\" Cizelj said.",
            "Were the reactors to come under attack by deliberate, targeted shelling, the risk would increase -- but even that would require a \"very, very skilled\" operation, he said.",
            "While Ukraine is not a member of the European Union, Cizelj told CNN that he expected Zaporizhzhia's precautions to be \"comparable\" to that of EU countries, where plants must adhere to strict nuclear safety rules.",
            "What is the worst-case scenario?",
            "Nuclear plants use a number of auxiliary safety systems, such as diesel generators and external grid connections, to keep reactors cool. Zaporizhzhia also uses a spray pond, a reservoir in which hot water from inside the plant is cooled. If those systems failed, then the nuclear reactor would heat up swiftly, triggering a nuclear meltdown.",
            "That would be the worst case scenario, experts said. But, while it would be disastrous at a local level, they explained it wouldn't have a major impact on Europe more widely.",
            "\"The main danger here is damage to the systems needed to keep the fuel in the reactor cool -- external power lines, emergency diesel generators, equipment to dissipate heat from the reactor core,\" Acton said.",
            "\"In a war, repairing this equipment or implementing countermeasures could be impossible. In the worst case, the fuel could melt and spread large amounts of radioactivity into the environment.\"",
            "An attack on structures used to store spent nuclear fuel -- fuel which is removed after use in a reactor -- also poses a risk, with the potential to release radioactive material into the surrounding area. But, experts said, it wouldn't travel far.",
            "The head of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said one strike earlier in August was close to the processed fuel storage area. \"This is very dangerous, because the rockets hit 10 to 20 meters away from the storage, but if they had hit the containers with the processed fuel, it would be a radiation accident,\" Kotin said on Ukrainian television.",
            "If one container is hit, \"it will be a local accident on the territory of the plant and nearby territory. If it's two to three containers, the affected area will increase,\" he added.",
            "How is Zaporizhzhia different to Chernobyl?",
            "Shelling around Zaporizhzhia has triggered warnings of another \"Chernobyl\" -- the world's worst-ever nuclear disaster.",
            "But there are numerous differences between the two Ukrainian power plants and experts insist that a repeat of the 1986 cataclysm is essentially impossible.",
            "The Chernobyl plant used Soviet-era, graphite-moderated RBMK reactors, which lacked a modern containment structure -- a concrete and steel dome designed to prevent any release of radiation.",
            "In contrast, each of the six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia facility are pressurized water reactors encased in a massive steel vessel, housed in a concrete containment building. The design is called VVER, the Russian acronym for water-water-energetic reactor.",
            "\"The brakes on these kinds of reactors are much much better,\" Cizelj said. \"If there would be damage to these reactors, it would be much easier to shut it down.\"",
            "The scale of a hypothetical nuclear meltdown would also be far smaller than that of Chernobyl, experts said. After the 1986 meltdown, radioactive fallout scattered across much of the northern hemisphere, while some 150,000 square kilometres in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine were contaminated, according to the IAEA. That contamination spread as far as 500 kilometers north of the site.",
            "Experts instead suggest that the feasible worst-case would look more like another, more recent disaster.",
            "\"Fukushima is a better analogy than Chernobyl,\" Acton said. \"In this event, evacuations may be required for tens of kilometers around the plant, especially downwind. In the middle of a war those would be exceptionally dangerous.\"",
            "Any radioactive fallout would spread around 10 or 20 kilometers from Zaporizhzhia before it would cease to pose serious health risks, experts suggest.",
            "\"If somebody was able to cause the meltdown of the reactors, (gases) could escape in the atmosphere and the would travel with the wind until they are washed out of the atmosphere,\" Cizelj said. \"With distance, dilution happens -- so very soon, the dilution becomes sufficient that the impact becomes not very serious for the environment and for people's health.\"",
            "But for people living in war-torn southern Ukraine, a nuclear disaster is not the most immediate danger. \"If you compare it to the other risks they are facing, this risk is not very large,\" he added."

Not only is this beneficial to those countries, but it could also prove valuable in a post-conflict propaganda war to convince average Russians of the benefits of European values.",

            "Will the EU work with Putin if he remains in power after the war? If not, how different must the regime that follows be from Putin's to satisfy the bloc? What would need to be included in a hypothetical treaty to assure different European leaders that Russia will not provoke further conflict? What might the EU be willing to concede in order to broker a peace? It's worth remembering throughout all of this that Ukraine is now a candidate for EU membership.",
            "All of these big questions create smaller questions, including what should be done during the conflict on visas. And the longer the war goes on, as the West's options for sanctions and retaliation become increasingly limited, the more of these questions will emerge.",
            "The hard reality is that these smaller questions, headaches in themselves, must be balanced against whatever is the best-case, long-term outcome of this bleak period. And the blunt truth is that one thing will never change: Europe cannot simply ignore Russia.",

        "Content": [
            "Seillans, France For well over a century, water has gurgled through a web of gutters and channels on C\u00e9cile Messelis' farm, flowing into an underground reservoir and earthen troughs to nourish crops sown across terraced fields.",
            "In 2020, that stream began to falter. This year, it stopped altogether: Messelis' fields now crackle in the sunlight; her stone cistern echoes with thirst.",
            "On this small farm in the upper reaches of Seillans, a commune in the Var region of southern France, the fields are bare but for the parched remnants of the last harvest. Normally, aubergines, tomatoes, peppers and melons thrive here. Now, the fields lie fallow.",
            "Messelis' reservoirs first ran empty after last winter was remarkably dry. She then had to rely on tap water to grow the organic fruit and vegetables that make up the baskets she sells to neighbors and at local markets.",
            "Then in May, local authorities tightened the taps as well.",
            "France is suffering what authorities say is likely its worst drought on record. It's a similar picture across much of Europe \u2014 more than 60% of land in the European Union is under drought warnings or more severe alerts, according to the European Drought Observatory.",
            "The rain has been so scant that major rivers are drying up in parts. The Loire and Rhone in France, the Po in Italy and the Rhine in Germany have all experienced particularly low water levels, some of them have even shrunk, impacting transport, agriculture and energy production.",
            "Now downpours are hitting several parts of the country. In the Loire region of central France, they've triggered flooding. The soil is so parched, like a dry sponge, it simply can't absorb that much rain. In Paris, floods that hit Tuesday evening forced 10 underground Metro stations to close. The stormy weather has brought relief from the heat, but little to break the drought. What's needed is less intense and more consistent rain over much longer periods of time.",
            "In January, when worries about the dry winter emerged, Seillans' authorities proposed to sell Messelis emergency water supplies that had been trucked in at \u20ac20 ($20.40) per cubic meter (around 264 gallons), she said. Private suppliers were offering only slightly cheaper rates. Normally, she would pay just around 50 cents ($0.51) for the same amount from the tap.",
            "It was an impossible option for her.",
            "\"It's not worth starting,\" the 54-year-old farmer told CNN. \"It's almost like we're working just to pay for the water.\"",
            "Unlike generations past, Messelis' neighbors today are more likely to have a swimming pool than a vegetable plot, a somewhat cruel irony for her this summer: In the first period of water restrictions, residents were still allowed to top up their pools, while her crops withered.",
            "\"It was a moment of shock,\" she said. \"It's so obvious that the priority [should be] to eat.\"",
            "Dark clouds",
            "In May, the people of Seillans were put under water rationing, given a 150 liters a day per person in the worst-hit part of the commune. It wasn't long until the rest of Seillans were given daily limits too, although of a higher 200 liters.",
            "It should be enough to cover basic needs \u2014 the average French person consumes 149 liters daily. But going unchecked, it's easy to use hundreds of liters more. Just running a tap while brushing teeth or between rinsing dishes wastes six liters of water every minute.",
            "Seillans was one of the first communities in France to run out of sufficient water for residents this year, but by early August, some 100 communes were in the same position, according to French Ecological Transition Minister Christophe B\u00e9chu.",
            "Many parts of the Var region have seen around 80% less rain than the long-term average between the start of July and August 10, according to the drought mission for the regional land and sea directorate. Some areas haven't seen any measurable rain at all.",
            "The region is now \"in a crisis,\" the mission's chief, Julien Assante, told CNN.",
            "Droughts in the Mediterranean region, where Seillans sits, have increased in frequency already because of the human-driven climate crisis, and the heat waves that can exacerbate them are also more common and more intense, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The more the Earth warms, the more the region will experience aridity, droughts and fire weather conditions.",
            "And drought isn't just impacting farmers and households. With it has come intense wildfires. More than 780,000 hectares (more than 3,000 square miles) across Europe have burned so far this year, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. So exhausted are France's firefighting resources that colleagues from Romania, Italy, Poland and Austria, as well as aircraft from Greece and Sweden, have been called in to battle the blazes.",
            "New rituals",
            "In the Ricou household, the drought has sparked a new ritual. Every few days, Brigitte Ricou climbs to the back of her shrubbery to photograph her water meter. It's the best way to monitor how much she, her husband and her visiting grandson are using.",
            "\"We look at our meter a lot,\" she told CNN from her kitchen in lower Seillans, where there is a 200-liter daily limit per resident. She said it was difficult to estimate how much water each person uses every day, and that it was something that required practice and thought.",
            "She and her husband have implemented a range of measures to limit their water use, from washing food in bowls and using that same water for their plants. They use bottled water for drinking, take shorter showers and they don't flush the toilet after every use.",
            "\"Sometimes I lower my consumption drastically to make my 200 liters,\" she said, adding that she doesn't view the quota as a right, as some people do, but as a maximum allowance. \"This water, it's precious.\"",
            "To Seillans Mayor Ren\u00e9 Ugo, water is more like a \"sacred\" resource. A small stream that used to run through the town all year round was once the lifeblood of a variety of businesses lower Seillans, from a perfume shop to an oil press, he said. But as it dried up, so too did business. This year, it hasn't flowed at all.",
            "\"It was a warning,\" Ugo said, referring to his observations of dry conditions back in January. \"I was afraid of what could happen and those fears came to pass.\"",
            "And in Seillans, the stopgap measures go well beyond rationing \u2014 the town is now trucking freshwater in. The local town hall oversaw the purchase of a water tanker, which now makes eight trundling return trips to restock the worst-hit districts' water reservoirs. Filling up from a fire hydrant fed by an underground source \u2014 the water naturally filtered by the rock \u2014 the truck deposits 8,000 liters at a time.",
            "While the mayor recognizes it's a short-term solution, it's also an investment for the future. There are no plans to sell the truck at the end of the dry season, he says, in an implicit acknowledgment that the village could face such shortages again.",
            "It's also a cost that local residents will have to shoulder, with higher water bills, the mayor said, another pain point as the cost of living crisis bites.",
            "For local police officer Philippe Gren\u00eache, extreme drought has become the new normal, and even part of his beat.",
            "He and his colleague now patrol the village looking for evidence of water-releated offences: Green lawns, for example, are a sure sign of sprinkler use, which is banned; swimming pools that appear to have been refilled are another sign of violations.",
            "People are sometimes even caught stealing water from fire hydrants.",
            "\"We had black gold,\" Gren\u00eache told CNN, referring to the value of petroleum, as his patrol car wound through the hills of Seillans. \"And now with all this, we've got 'blue gold.'\""

            "(CNN)Nearly 10 years after he was driven underground, Salman Rushdie believed he was free. The author had been living under heavy security and highest secrecy in London. But in 1998, the Iranian government of President Mohammad Khatami publicly distanced itself from the religious fatwa calling for his murder.",
            "The move was part of a landmark agreement with the United Kingdom. Iran issued a public guarantee not to push for Rushdie's murder in exchange for an upgrade in diplomatic relations between London and Tehran.",
            "\"Well, it looks like it's over,\" Rushdie told reporters at the time. \"It means everything. It means freedom.\"",

The murderous 1989 decree over Rushdie's satirical novel The Satanic Verses could not be officially revoked because the source of the fatwa \u2014 Iran's first Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini \u2014 was dead. At least that's what Rushdie was told, according to his memoir.",
            "It was a deftly-crafted ambiguity that has defined Iran's policy over the issue -- and many other issues -- in the intervening years. In 2006, Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Iran-backed Hezbollah, publicly lamented that the fatwa against the author had not been carried out, claiming it emboldened others to \"insult\" the Prophet Mohammed. In 2019, Iran's current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei reminded his followers that the ruling against Rushdie was \"solid and irrevocable,\" in a tweet that led to the shutting down of his account.

The Satanic Verses draws on a deeply controversial story in early Islamic tradition that claims that Satan momentarily intruded in the divine revelations to the Prophet Mohammed. Iran didn't ban the book straightaway; the country's rulers only took action several months later, after the book inspired protests in Pakistan.",
            "The ensuing fatwa proved to be politically useful. It elevated Khomeini in the eyes of Islam's fundamentalists across the Muslim world, including among Sunnis. Yet then, as now, it had its prominent Muslim and regional detractors.",
            "The New Yorker's Robin Wright reports that Khomeini's closest protege at the time, Ayatollah Ali Montazeri, criticized the decree. Montazeri, who also opposed mass executions of Iran's dissidents, fell out of favor with the regime and was placed under house arrest in 1997.",

            "In Rushdie's memoir Joseph Anton, the Mumbai-born author is depicted openly questioning whether he was being \"sold out\" by the London-Tehran 1998 agreement only days after he declared the threats to his life \"over.\" Joseph Anton was his pseudonym during his time underground and he refers to himself in the book in the third person.",

            "Background: Iran is exchanging messages with the United States through mediation on three remaining issues, one of which is \"guarantees,\" Amir-Abdollahian said. \"The American side has shown flexibility on two issues, which have been taken into account, and now needs to show flexibility regarding guarantees,\" he said. The US State Department did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. During the briefing, Amir-Abdollahian made no mention of the Iran's previous demand that an IAEA investigation into traces of uranium at three undeclared sites is dropped.\nWhy it matters: The revival of the nuclear deal which the US withdrew from in 2018 appeared to be nearing completion earlier this year.

At least 18 children were killed, according to hospital documents seen by CNN. The children were between the ages of 3 and 16. The fire was caused by an electrical failure in an air conditioning unit, the interior ministry said.\nWhy it matters: The incident highlights the dangers posed by parts of Egypt's underdeveloped infrastructure, especially in the country's poorer and crowded neighborhoods.

The weapon he carried was seized, according to a police spokesperson. Israeli media said the suspect is a Palestinian who holds Israeli citizenship.

            "No, it's not that asteroid, the one that doomed the dinosaurs to extinction, but a previously unknown crater 248 miles off the coast of West Africa that was created right around the same time. Further study of the Nadir crater, as it's called, could shake up what we know about that cataclysmic moment in natural history.",
            "Uisdean Nicholson, an assistant professor at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, happened on the crater by accident -- he was reviewing seismic survey data for another project on the tectonic split between South America and Africa and found evidence of the crater beneath 400 meters of seabed sediment.",
            "\"While interpreting the data, I (came) across this very unusual crater-like feature, unlike anything I had ever seen before,\" he said.",
            "\"It had all the characteristics of an impact crater.\"",
            "To be absolutely certain the crater was caused by an asteroid strike, he said that it would be necessary to drill into the the crater and test minerals from the crater floor. But it has all the hallmarks scientists would expect: the right ratio of crater width to depth, the height of the rims, and the height of the central uplift -- a mound in the center created by rock and sediment forced up by the shock pressure.",
            "The journal Science Advances published the study on Thursday.",
            "\"The discovery of a terrestrial impact crater is always significant, because they are very rare in the geologic record. There are fewer than 200 confirmed impact structures on Earth and quite a few likely candidates that haven't yet been unequivocally confirmed,\" said Mark Boslough, a research professor in Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of New Mexico. He was not involved in this research but agreed that it was probably caused by an asteroid.",

            "While much smaller than the city-sized asteroid that caused the 100-mile-wide Chicxulub crater that hit off the coast of Mexico that led to the mass extinction of much of life on the planet, it's still a pretty sizable space rock.",
            "\"The (Nadir) impact would have had severe consequences locally and regionally -- across the Atlantic Ocean at least,\" Nicholson explained via email.",
            "\"There would have been a large earthquake (magnitude 6.5 - 7), so significant ground shaking locally. The air blast would have been heard across the globe, and would have itself caused severe local damage across the region.",

            "By comparison, the in-air explosion of a much smaller 50-meter wide asteroid in 1908 in Russia, known as the Tunguska event flattened a forest across an area of 1,000 square kilometers.",
            "\"At 400 meters or so, the air blast (that caused the crater off West Africa) would have been orders of magnitude larger.\"",
            "Information from microfossils in nearby exploration wells show that the crater was formed around 66 million years ago -- at the end of the Cretaceous period. However, there's still uncertainty -- margin or error of around 1 million years -- about its exact age.",
            "Nicholson said it was possible that the asteroid strike was linked to the Chicxulub impact, or it could simply be a coincidence -- an asteroid of this size would hit Earth every 700,000 years.",
            "If linked, the asteroid could be the result of a break-up of a parent asteroid near the Earth -- with the separate fragments dispersed during an earlier orbit of Earth, or it was possible that it was part of a longer-lived shower of asteroids that hit the Earth over a period of a million years or so.",
            "\"Finding out the precise age is really critical to test this -- again, only possible by drilling.\"",
            "Even if linked, it would have been dwarfed by the Chicxulub impact, but it would have still added to the overall cascading set of consequences, he said.",
            "\"Understanding the exact nature of the relationship with Chicxulub (if any) is important to understand what was going on in the inner solar system at that time and raised some interesting new questions,\" Nicholson said.",

            "Since 2019, the US and dozens of other countries around the world have said they do not consider Maduro's presidency legitimate, recognizing instead opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim head of state. Yet current US President Joe Biden's Biden White House has dispatched senior officials to Caracas three times this year to meet Maduro and his representatives, in an effort to negotiate for the detained Americans.",
            "Although the Biden administration has hardly laid out the red carpet - it refused to invite Maduro to this year's Summit of the Americas, and maintained personal sanctions on Venezuelan government officials - the fact that top officials are meeting directly with Maduro to discuss the detainees suggests that the White House has abandoned the Trump-era tactic of freezing out the authoritarian leader.",
            "The effort appears separate from parallel conversations seeking to boost Venezuela's oil output under the pressure of rising gas prices globally -- and from the backstage political negotiations encouraged by Washington between Maduro and the Guaido-led opposition, so far a slow-moving process.",
            "Concessions on principle",

That proposed swap overrides opposition from the Department of Justice, which is generally against prisoner trades.",

            "In June, the US Department of Treasury did allow two European companies, ENI and Repsol, to resume exports from Venezuela, partially in an attempt to lower oil prices that have spiked worldwide as a consequence of the war in Ukraine. Still, the general sanctions on trading Venezuelan oil remain.",

Gerardo Blyde, the chief negotiator on behalf of the opposition, and Jorge Rodriguez, Maduro's representative, met in Caracas in May with the promise of travelling together to Mexico to resume talks -- but so far nothing has happened. Both the foreign ministry of Norway, which brokered the Venezuelan talks, and the Venezuelan information ministry declined to comment.",
            "All this comes at an excellent time for Maduro, who has enjoyed a bump in popularity as economic conditions improve slightly. Although hampered by US sanctions, the global spike in oil prices has had a positive impact on Venezuela's public finances. And inflation in Venezuela, while still high, is now more in tune with increases in the rest of the world. (For a country used to prices doubling within a month, a 6% monthly inflation rate is almost healthy.)",

The Category 4 storm decimated the antiquated power grid, leaving more than a million people without electricity or running water for what would become months.",

The song gave voice to the historic moment, touching on homophobia, government mismanagement and neglect, and homes left roofless by hurricanes.",

            "In 2018, V\u00e1zquez came under fire for allegedly intervening on behalf of her daughter in a case stemming from a home theft. She faced charges of violating government ethics laws. But a judge later ruled there was insufficient evidence to arrest her.",
            "V\u00e1zquez's ties to Rossell\u00f3 brought scrutiny during her brief tenure as governor under the ruling pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Critics accused her of failing to open investigations against members of her own party, particularly Rossell\u00f3 and his administration's handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.",
            "In January 2020, Puerto Ricans poured onto the streets of San Juan calling for her resignation after Maria relief supplies were found in a warehouse in the city of Ponce, more than two years after the storm.",
            "Later that year, Puerto Rican officials confirmed V\u00e1zquez was being investigated for suspicion of mishandling resources meant to mitigate earthquake damage on the island.",

            "Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO's standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.",

More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city.",
            "The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world's major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year.

And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.",

            "Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.",
            "The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That's roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.",

            "Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.",
            "Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report's authors told CNN.",
            "CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers \u2014 Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target \u2014 to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?",
            "Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks \u2014 regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves \u2014 that are preventing more widespread adoption.",
            "The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming \"unquestionably urgent\" as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.",
            "\"We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,\" Cowen told CNN. \"I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There's still a tremendous amount of work to do.\"",
            "What's the holdup?",
            "Neumann said Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space \u2014 an area larger than Manhattan \u2014 and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.",
            "It's enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.",
            "Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.",
            "Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it's aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.",
            "\"Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,\" Neumann told CNN. \"And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.\"",
            "According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company's installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location's electricity needs.",
            "Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association's most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar \u2014 around a quarter of the company's stores \u2014 a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties' energy needs, the spokesperson said.",
            "Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.",
            "Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.",
            "\"My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,\" Neumann said. \"Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.\"",
            "Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D'Arcy, the company's director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores' energy needs on average, he said.",
            "Aging rooftops at stores are a \"huge impediment\" to solar installation, D'Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn't make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.",
            "\"We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,\" D'Arcy told CNN.",
            "CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties \u2014 stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants \u2014 with solar installations. One of the \"multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation\" was the stores' ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.",
            "Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.",
            "\"For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,\" Cowen said. \"It's just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.\"",
            "Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has \"failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.\" The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because \"our system is so disjointed\" and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.",
            "\"Why aren't we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,\" Casten told CNN. \"For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn't want to lose the load.",
            "\"We could have done this decades ago,\" Casten added. \"And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we'd also have a lot more money in our pocket.\"",
            "Acting on climate, equitably",
            "For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.",
            "Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels \u2014 and it's doable, Callaway told CNN.",
            "The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.",
            "In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.",
            "\"One of my huge concerns is social equity,\" Cowen said. \"Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we've got to figure out ways to make that not true.\"",
            "Jasmine Graham, WE ACT's energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only \"if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.\"",
            "Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.",
            "Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.",
            "\"The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we'll have cleaner air, the sooner we'll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we'll have a more livable future for our kids,\" Neumann said. \"And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.\""

            "The threat of nuclear calamity has hung for months over Russia's war in Ukraine.",
            "Those fears were renewed last week after shelling intensified around the massive Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, which has been under Russian control since March.",
            "Attacks at the complex, which have ramped up as fighting flares in Ukraine's south, have sparked concerns about the specter of nuclear disaster, leading the United Nation's watchdog and world leaders to demand that a mission be allowed to visit the site and assess the damage.",
            "So just how real is the risk that the fighting poses?",
            "Nuclear experts are keen to defuse some of the more alarmist warnings, explaining that the main threat is closest to the plant itself and doesn't justify Europe-wide alerts. Experts are particularly wary of any comparisons to the Chernobyl disaster, a repeat of which is incredibly unlikely, they said.",
            "\"It's not very likely that this plant will be damaged,\" Leon Cizelj, president of the European Nuclear Society, told CNN. \"In the very unlikely case that it is, the radioactive problem would mostly affect Ukrainians that live nearby,\" rather than spreading throughout eastern Europe as was the case with Chernobyl, he said.",
            "\"If we used past experience, Fukushima could be a comparison of the worst-case scenario,\" Cizelj added, referring to the serious but more localized meltdown at the Japanese plant in 2011. The most pressing dangers would be faced by Ukrainians living in the vicinity of the plant, which is on the banks of the Dnipro River, south of Zaporizhzhia city, and by the Ukrainian staff who are still working there.",
            "Here's what you need to know about the clashes at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, and what their implications could be.",
            "What's happening at the Zaporizhzhia plant?",
            "Shellfire at the Zaporizhzhia plant in recent weeks has damaged a dry storage facility -- where casks of spent nuclear fuel are kept at the plant -- as well as radiation monitoring detectors, according to Energoatom, Ukraine's state-run nuclear power company.",
            "On August 5, several explosions near the electrical switchboard caused a power shutdown and one reactor was disconnected from the electrical grid, the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief said.",
            "Rafael Mariano Grossi told the UN Security Council that the situation had deteriorated \"to the point of being very alarming.\"",
            "Kyiv has repeatedly accused Russian forces of storing heavy weaponry inside the complex and using it as cover to launch attacks, knowing that Ukraine can't return fire without risking hitting one of the plant's six reactors. Moscow, meanwhile, has claimed Ukrainian troops are targeting the site. Both sides have tried to point the finger at the other for threatening nuclear terrorism.",
            "Calls are growing for an IAEA mission to be allowed to visit the complex. But fighting has continued despite the concern.",
            "On Tuesday, Ukrainian authorities said the town of Nikopol, across the Dnipro River from the plant, had again come under rocket fire again.",
            "\"The shelling has threatened the safety of operators working on the site, and there have been reports that a worker was hit by shrapnel and taken to hospital,\" Henry Preston, a communications manager at the London-based World Nuclear Association, told CNN.",
            "He called the workers' professionalism under occupation \"remarkable\" and the use of an operational power plant for military activities \"unconscionable.\"",
            "How secure are the plant's nuclear reactors?",
            "Modern nuclear power plants are extremely well reinforced to prevent damage from all kinds of attacks, such as earthquakes, and Zaporizhzhia is no exception.",
            "\"Like all nuclear power plants, Zaporizhzhia contains various redundant safety systems, which under normal circumstances are highly effective,\" James Acton, the co\u2011director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN.",
            "\"The problem is that nuclear power plants are not designed for war zones and, under plausible circumstances, all these systems could fail,\" he added.",
            "The plant's six reactors -- only two of which are currently functioning -- are protected by steel and meters-thick concrete casing. \"Random shelling cannot really destroy this, it would be really improbable,\" Cizelj said.",
            "Were the reactors to come under attack by deliberate, targeted shelling, the risk would increase -- but even that would require a \"very, very skilled\" operation, he said.",
            "While Ukraine is not a member of the European Union, Cizelj told CNN that he expected Zaporizhzhia's precautions to be \"comparable\" to that of EU countries, where plants must adhere to strict nuclear safety rules.",
            "What is the worst-case scenario?",
            "Nuclear plants use a number of auxiliary safety systems, such as diesel generators and external grid connections, to keep reactors cool. Zaporizhzhia also uses a spray pond, a reservoir in which hot water from inside the plant is cooled. If those systems failed, then the nuclear reactor would heat up swiftly, triggering a nuclear meltdown.",
            "That would be the worst case scenario, experts said. But, while it would be disastrous at a local level, they explained it wouldn't have a major impact on Europe more widely.",
            "\"The main danger here is damage to the systems needed to keep the fuel in the reactor cool -- external power lines, emergency diesel generators, equipment to dissipate heat from the reactor core,\" Acton said.",
            "\"In a war, repairing this equipment or implementing countermeasures could be impossible. In the worst case, the fuel could melt and spread large amounts of radioactivity into the environment.\"",
            "An attack on structures used to store spent nuclear fuel -- fuel which is removed after use in a reactor -- also poses a risk, with the potential to release radioactive material into the surrounding area. But, experts said, it wouldn't travel far.",
            "The head of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said one strike earlier in August was close to the processed fuel storage area. \"This is very dangerous, because the rockets hit 10 to 20 meters away from the storage, but if they had hit the containers with the processed fuel, it would be a radiation accident,\" Kotin said on Ukrainian television.",
            "If one container is hit, \"it will be a local accident on the territory of the plant and nearby territory. If it's two to three containers, the affected area will increase,\" he added.",
            "How is Zaporizhzhia different to Chernobyl?",
            "Shelling around Zaporizhzhia has triggered warnings of another \"Chernobyl\" -- the world's worst-ever nuclear disaster.",
            "But there are numerous differences between the two Ukrainian power plants and experts insist that a repeat of the 1986 cataclysm is essentially impossible.",
            "The Chernobyl plant used Soviet-era, graphite-moderated RBMK reactors, which lacked a modern containment structure -- a concrete and steel dome designed to prevent any release of radiation.",
            "In contrast, each of the six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia facility are pressurized water reactors encased in a massive steel vessel, housed in a concrete containment building. The design is called VVER, the Russian acronym for water-water-energetic reactor.",
            "\"The brakes on these kinds of reactors are much much better,\" Cizelj said. \"If there would be damage to these reactors, it would be much easier to shut it down.\"",
            "The scale of a hypothetical nuclear meltdown would also be far smaller than that of Chernobyl, experts said. After the 1986 meltdown, radioactive fallout scattered across much of the northern hemisphere, while some 150,000 square kilometres in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine were contaminated, according to the IAEA. That contamination spread as far as 500 kilometers north of the site.",
            "Experts instead suggest that the feasible worst-case would look more like another, more recent disaster.",
            "\"Fukushima is a better analogy than Chernobyl,\" Acton said. \"In this event, evacuations may be required for tens of kilometers around the plant, especially downwind. In the middle of a war those would be exceptionally dangerous.\"",
            "Any radioactive fallout would spread around 10 or 20 kilometers from Zaporizhzhia before it would cease to pose serious health risks, experts suggest.",
            "\"If somebody was able to cause the meltdown of the reactors, (gases) could escape in the atmosphere and the would travel with the wind until they are washed out of the atmosphere,\" Cizelj said. \"With distance, dilution happens -- so very soon, the dilution becomes sufficient that the impact becomes not very serious for the environment and for people's health.\"",
            "But for people living in war-torn southern Ukraine, a nuclear disaster is not the most immediate danger. \"If you compare it to the other risks they are facing, this risk is not very large,\" he added."

            "No, it's not that asteroid, the one that doomed the dinosaurs to extinction, but a previously unknown crater 248 miles off the coast of West Africa that was created right around the same time. Further study of the Nadir crater, as it's called, could shake up what we know about that cataclysmic moment in natural history.",
            "Uisdean Nicholson, an assistant professor at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, happened on the crater by accident -- he was reviewing seismic survey data for another project on the tectonic split between South America and Africa and found evidence of the crater beneath 400 meters of seabed sediment.",

            "\"It had all the characteristics of an impact crater.\"",
            "To be absolutely certain the crater was caused by an asteroid strike, he said that it would be necessary to drill into the the crater and test minerals from the crater floor. But it has all the hallmarks scientists would expect: the right ratio of crater width to depth, the height of the rims, and the height of the central uplift -- a mound in the center created by rock and sediment forced up by the shock pressure.",

            "\"The discovery of a terrestrial impact crater is always significant, because they are very rare in the geologic record. There are fewer than 200 confirmed impact structures on Earth and quite a few likely candidates that haven't yet been unequivocally confirmed,\" said Mark Boslough, a research professor in Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of New Mexico. He was not involved in this research but agreed that it was probably caused by an asteroid.",

            "While much smaller than the city-sized asteroid that caused the 100-mile-wide Chicxulub crater that hit off the coast of Mexico that led to the mass extinction of much of life on the planet, it's still a pretty sizable space rock.",
            "\"The (Nadir) impact would have had severe consequences locally and regionally -- across the Atlantic Ocean at least,\" Nicholson explained via email.",
            "\"There would have been a large earthquake (magnitude 6.5 - 7), so significant ground shaking locally. The air blast would have been heard across the globe, and would have itself caused severe local damage across the region.",
            "It would have caused an \"exceptionally large\" tsunami wave up 3,200 feet high (1 kilometer) around the crater, dissipating to around five meters high once it reached South America.",
            "By comparison, the in-air explosion of a much smaller 50-meter wide asteroid in 1908 in Russia, known as the Tunguska event flattened a forest across an area of 1,000 square kilometers.",

            "Nicholson said it was possible that the asteroid strike was linked to the Chicxulub impact, or it could simply be a coincidence -- an asteroid of this size would hit Earth every 700,000 years.",
            "If linked, the asteroid could be the result of a break-up of a parent asteroid near the Earth -- with the separate fragments dispersed during an earlier orbit of Earth, or it was possible that it was part of a longer-lived shower of asteroids that hit the Earth over a period of a million years or so.",
            "\"Finding out the precise age is really critical to test this -- again, only possible by drilling.\"",

            "There is a gendered dimension to every one of our major global challenges including, but not limited to: climate change, economic or health inequality, the rise of authoritarianism, mass migration or algorithmic bias. Critical, tenacious journalism is required to expose it all.",
            "With stories on underreported issues in underreported parts of the world, told by underrepresented voices, As Equals intends to spotlight taboo subjects, use innovative presentations and effect change.",
            "Staffed by a dedicated team, As Equals will broaden the scope of gender reporting and build on CNN's already-established reputation for independent, world-class, mobile-first, thought-provoking journalism, with production across CNN's platforms, including newsletters and audio, documentaries, as well as events.",
            "How is As Equals funded?",
            "As Equals originally launched in 2018 with the assistance of a year-long Innovation in Development Reporting grant from the European Journalism Centre. The series kept going after 2019 thanks to commitment by CNN.",

            "Several regions on the Yangtze have launched weather modification programs, but with cloud cover too thin, operations in some drought-ravaged parts of the river's basin have remained on standby.",
            "The Ministry of Water Resources said in a notice on Wednesday that drought throughout the Yangtze river basin was \"adversely affecting drinking water security of rural people and livestock, and the growth of crops.\"",
            "On Wednesday, central China's Hubei province became the latest to announce it would seed clouds, using silver iodide rods to induce rainfall.",
            "The silver iodide rods -- which are typically the size of cigarettes -- are shot into existing clouds to help form ice crystals. The crystals then help the cloud produce more rain, making its moisture content heavier and more likely to be released.",
            "Cloud seeding has been in practice since the 1940s and China has the biggest program in the world. It used seeding ahead of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 to ensure dry weather for the event, and the technique can also be used to induce snowfall or to soften hail.",
            "At least 4.2 million people in Hubei have been affected by a severe drought since June, Hubei's Provincial Emergency Management Department said Tuesday. More than 150,000 people there have difficulties accessing drinking water, and nearly 400,000 hectares of crops have been damaged because of high temperatures and drought.",
            "The Yangtze is just one of many rivers and lakes across the northern hemisphere that are drying up and shrinking amid relentless heat and low rainfall, including Lake Mead in the US and the Rhine River in Germany. These extreme weather conditions have been supercharged by the human-induced climate crisis, driven by burning fossil fuels.",

            "China is deploying such funds and developing new supply sources to deal with the impacts on crops and livestock. Some livestock has been temporarily relocated to other regions, the Ministry of Finance said earlier this week, adding it would issue 300 million yuan ($44.30 million) in disaster relief.",
            "To boost downstream supplies, the Three Gorges Dam, China's biggest hydropower project, will also increase water discharges by 500 million cubic meters over the next 10 days, the Ministry of Water Resources said Tuesday.",
            "The heat also forced authorities in the southwestern province of Sichuan -- home to around 84 million people and a key manufacturing hub -- to order the shutdown of all factories for six days this week to ease a power shortage.",
            "'Longest' and 'strongest' heat wave on record",
            "China issued its highest red alert heat warning for at least 138 cities and counties across the country on Wednesday, and another 373 were placed under the second-highest orange alert, the Meteorological Administration said.",
            "As of Monday, China's heat wave had lasted 64 days, making it the longest in more than six decades, since full records began in 1961, the National Climate Center said in a statement. It also said it was the \"strongest\" on record and warned that it could worsen in the coming days.",
            "\"The heat wave this time is prolonged, wide in scope, and strong in extremity,\" the statement read. \"Taken all signs together, the heat wave in China will continue and its intensity will increase.\"",
            "The heat wave has also registered the largest number of counties and cities exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) since records began, according to the statement. The number of weather stations recording temperatures of 40C and above has reached 262, also the highest. Eight have hit 44C.",
            "Persistently high temperatures are forecast to continue in the Sichuan Basin and large parts of central China until August 26.",
            "A \"special case\" of high pressure from the West Pacific subtropical high, stretching across much of Asia, is likely to be the cause of the extreme heat, said Cai Wenju, climate researcher with CSIRO, Australia's national scientific research institute."

            "Seillans, France For well over a century, water has gurgled through a web of gutters and channels on C\u00e9cile Messelis' farm, flowing into an underground reservoir and earthen troughs to nourish crops sown across terraced fields.",
            "In 2020, that stream began to falter. This year, it stopped altogether: Messelis' fields now crackle in the sunlight; her stone cistern echoes with thirst.",
            "On this small farm in the upper reaches of Seillans, a commune in the Var region of southern France, the fields are bare but for the parched remnants of the last harvest. Normally, aubergines, tomatoes, peppers and melons thrive here. Now, the fields lie fallow.",
            "Messelis' reservoirs first ran empty after last winter was remarkably dry. She then had to rely on tap water to grow the organic fruit and vegetables that make up the baskets she sells to neighbors and at local markets.",
            "Then in May, local authorities tightened the taps as well.",
            "France is suffering what authorities say is likely its worst drought on record. It's a similar picture across much of Europe \u2014 more than 60% of land in the European Union is under drought warnings or more severe alerts, according to the European Drought Observatory.",
            "The rain has been so scant that major rivers are drying up in parts. The Loire and Rhone in France, the Po in Italy and the Rhine in Germany have all experienced particularly low water levels, some of them have even shrunk, impacting transport, agriculture and energy production.",
            "Now downpours are hitting several parts of the country. In the Loire region of central France, they've triggered flooding. The soil is so parched, like a dry sponge, it simply can't absorb that much rain. In Paris, floods that hit Tuesday evening forced 10 underground Metro stations to close. The stormy weather has brought relief from the heat, but little to break the drought. What's needed is less intense and more consistent rain over much longer periods of time.",
            "In January, when worries about the dry winter emerged, Seillans' authorities proposed to sell Messelis emergency water supplies that had been trucked in at \u20ac20 ($20.40) per cubic meter (around 264 gallons), she said. Private suppliers were offering only slightly cheaper rates. Normally, she would pay just around 50 cents ($0.51) for the same amount from the tap.",
            "It was an impossible option for her.",
            "\"It's not worth starting,\" the 54-year-old farmer told CNN. \"It's almost like we're working just to pay for the water.\"",
            "Unlike generations past, Messelis' neighbors today are more likely to have a swimming pool than a vegetable plot, a somewhat cruel irony for her this summer: In the first period of water restrictions, residents were still allowed to top up their pools, while her crops withered.",
            "\"It was a moment of shock,\" she said. \"It's so obvious that the priority [should be] to eat.\"",
            "Dark clouds",
            "In May, the people of Seillans were put under water rationing, given a 150 liters a day per person in the worst-hit part of the commune. It wasn't long until the rest of Seillans were given daily limits too, although of a higher 200 liters.",
            "It should be enough to cover basic needs \u2014 the average French person consumes 149 liters daily. But going unchecked, it's easy to use hundreds of liters more. Just running a tap while brushing teeth or between rinsing dishes wastes six liters of water every minute.",
            "Seillans was one of the first communities in France to run out of sufficient water for residents this year, but by early August, some 100 communes were in the same position, according to French Ecological Transition Minister Christophe B\u00e9chu.",
            "Many parts of the Var region have seen around 80% less rain than the long-term average between the start of July and August 10, according to the drought mission for the regional land and sea directorate. Some areas haven't seen any measurable rain at all.",
            "The region is now \"in a crisis,\" the mission's chief, Julien Assante, told CNN.",
            "Droughts in the Mediterranean region, where Seillans sits, have increased in frequency already because of the human-driven climate crisis, and the heat waves that can exacerbate them are also more common and more intense, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The more the Earth warms, the more the region will experience aridity, droughts and fire weather conditions.",
            "And drought isn't just impacting farmers and households. With it has come intense wildfires. More than 780,000 hectares (more than 3,000 square miles) across Europe have burned so far this year, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. So exhausted are France's firefighting resources that colleagues from Romania, Italy, Poland and Austria, as well as aircraft from Greece and Sweden, have been called in to battle the blazes.",
            "New rituals",
            "In the Ricou household, the drought has sparked a new ritual. Every few days, Brigitte Ricou climbs to the back of her shrubbery to photograph her water meter. It's the best way to monitor how much she, her husband and her visiting grandson are using.",
            "\"We look at our meter a lot,\" she told CNN from her kitchen in lower Seillans, where there is a 200-liter daily limit per resident. She said it was difficult to estimate how much water each person uses every day, and that it was something that required practice and thought.",
            "She and her husband have implemented a range of measures to limit their water use, from washing food in bowls and using that same water for their plants. They use bottled water for drinking, take shorter showers and they don't flush the toilet after every use.",
            "\"Sometimes I lower my consumption drastically to make my 200 liters,\" she said, adding that she doesn't view the quota as a right, as some people do, but as a maximum allowance. \"This water, it's precious.\"",
            "To Seillans Mayor Ren\u00e9 Ugo, water is more like a \"sacred\" resource. A small stream that used to run through the town all year round was once the lifeblood of a variety of businesses lower Seillans, from a perfume shop to an oil press, he said. But as it dried up, so too did business. This year, it hasn't flowed at all.",
            "\"It was a warning,\" Ugo said, referring to his observations of dry conditions back in January. \"I was afraid of what could happen and those fears came to pass.\"",
            "And in Seillans, the stopgap measures go well beyond rationing \u2014 the town is now trucking freshwater in. The local town hall oversaw the purchase of a water tanker, which now makes eight trundling return trips to restock the worst-hit districts' water reservoirs. Filling up from a fire hydrant fed by an underground source \u2014 the water naturally filtered by the rock \u2014 the truck deposits 8,000 liters at a time.",
            "While the mayor recognizes it's a short-term solution, it's also an investment for the future. There are no plans to sell the truck at the end of the dry season, he says, in an implicit acknowledgment that the village could face such shortages again.",
            "It's also a cost that local residents will have to shoulder, with higher water bills, the mayor said, another pain point as the cost of living crisis bites.",
            "For local police officer Philippe Gren\u00eache, extreme drought has become the new normal, and even part of his beat.",
            "He and his colleague now patrol the village looking for evidence of water-releated offences: Green lawns, for example, are a sure sign of sprinkler use, which is banned; swimming pools that appear to have been refilled are another sign of violations.",
            "People are sometimes even caught stealing water from fire hydrants.",
            "\"We had black gold,\" Gren\u00eache told CNN, referring to the value of petroleum, as his patrol car wound through the hills of Seillans. \"And now with all this, we've got 'blue gold.'\""

            "Berlin and Jerusalem (CNN)Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas struck a deep nerve on Tuesday when he said Israel has caused \"50 Holocausts\" against Palestinians, triggering outrage from world leaders and a social media storm.",
            "\"From 1947 to the present day, Israel has committed 50 massacres in Palestinian villages and cities,\" Abbas said in Arabic, standing next to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at a news conference in Berlin. \"50 massacres, 50 Holocausts, and until today, and every day there are casualties killed by the Israeli military.\"",
            "Abbas had been asked by a journalist if he would apologize for the 1972 Olympics massacre in Munich, when members of the Israeli team were taken hostage by Palestinian gunmen, at the time part of a splinter group of Abbas' Fatah party, leading to the death of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches, and one West German policeman, following an armed standoff.",

            "Germany's ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, tweeted that, \"What President #Abbas said in Berlin about \"50 holocausts\" is wrong and unacceptable. Germany will never stand for any attempt to deny the singular dimension of the crimes of the Holocaust.\"",
            "Israeli leaders also widely condemned the remark, with Prime Minister Yair Lapid saying, \"Mahmoud Abbas accusing Israel of having committed '50 Holocausts' while standing on German soil is not only a moral disgrace, but a monstrous lie.\"",
            "\"Six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, including one and a half million Jewish children. History will never forgive him,\" tweeted Lapid.",
            "Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz described Abbas' words as \"despicable and false.\" \"His statement is an attempt to distort and rewrite history,\" Gantz said.",
            "Global figures also criticized the remarks. The US State Department's Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, Ambassador Deborah E. Lipstadt, described them as \"unacceptable,\" adding that, \"Holocaust distortion can have dangerous consequences and fuels antisemitism.\"",
            "Abbas' staff sought to clarify his comments on Wednesday. \"President Mahmoud Abbas reaffirms that the Holocaust is the most heinous crime that has occurred in modern human history,\" read a statement from his office.",
            "His answer \"was not intended to deny the specificity of the Holocaust, which was committed in the last century, and is condemned in the strongest terms,\" it added.",
            "\"What is meant by the crimes that ... Abbas spoke of are the massacres committed against the Palestinian people since the Nakba by Israeli forces, crimes that have not stopped to this day,\" the statement concluded. This refers to the establishment of Israel in 1948, called al-Nakba or \"the catastrophe\" by Palestinians, after more than 700,000 Palestinians were either expelled from or fled their homes during the resulting Arab-Israeli war.",
            "This is not the first time that Abbas has made remarks deemed antisemitic. As a doctoral student in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, Abbas wrote a thesis that alleged a secret relationship between Nazis and early advocates for a Jewish state, according to Reuters. His claims resurfaced as an issue in 2018, when he said that Jews living in Europe had suffered since the 11th century \"not because of their religion, [but] it was because of their social profession.\"",
            "\"So the Jewish issue that had spread against the Jews across Europe was not because of their religion, it was because of usury and banks,\" he said during an opening speech at Palestinian National Council (PNC), the de facto parliament for the Palestine Liberation Organization.",

            "The Syrian government has denied that it \"kidnapped\" or is \"hiding\" American citizen Austin Tice, who went missing in the country a decade ago.",
            "Background: Tice, a freelance journalist, was detained at a checkpoint near Syrian capital Damascus in August 2012 while reporting on the country's civil war. US President Joe Biden last week declared that the US government knows \"with certainty that he has been held by the Syrian regime.\" The Syrian foreign ministry said Wednesday that accusations against the Syrian government that it has \"arrested\" Tice are false. The ministry added: \"Syria reaffirms that any dialogue or official communication with the US government will be public and based on respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and non-interference in its internal affairs.\"",
            "Why it matters: Relations between the United States and Syria have been strained since the start of the Syrian conflict, and Washington has sanctioned several regime officials and militia leaders. It continues to call for a political solution to war, which has now raged for more than 10 years. Securing Tice's release would also be a boost to Biden's domestic popularity, as his administration has come under fire for not doing enough to bring Americans stuck abroad back home.",

            "Israel and Turkey will restore full diplomatic ties between the two countries, including returning ambassadors and consul generals to their respective posts, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid announced on Wednesday.",
            "Background: Turkey expelled Israel's ambassador to the country in 2018 in response to the killing of 60 Palestinians by the Israeli military during protests along Gaza's border, which were sparked by the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem. Israel in turn expelled Turkey's ambassador to Israel. Israeli President Isaac Herzog's visit to Turkey in March, followed by visits by both countries' foreign ministers, helped thaw tensions after more than a decade of strained relations.\nWhy it matters: Israel has been enjoying improved relations with regional countries without any progress towards a two-state solution with the Palestinians. The Biden administration has increasingly made it clear that it sees the Abraham Accords -- a series of normalization agreements signed between Israel and Arab states -- as a key plank of its Middle East diplomacy and has encouraged other regional states like Jordan and Egypt to work more closely within its framework.",

            "Background: Last week EU officials sent the US and Iran what it called the \"final text\" of a revived deal to limit Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. On Monday night, Iran responded to the proposal in writing, meeting a deadline set by the bloc. While Iran's written response has not been made public, the country's chief adviser to negotiations tweeted that an agreement was closer than ever, but not yet done. Tehran is seeking guarantees it will be compensated if a future US President pulls out of the pact, a regional diplomat told CNN on Tuesday. The State Department spokesperson would not characterize the US sentiment upon receiving the Iranian response.\nWhy it matters: Attempts to revive the deal, which former US President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018, have been ongoing for months, with negotiations between the US and Iran being mediated by the EU and Qatar. Iran has said any final deal should protect the rights of the country and guarantee the lifting of sanctions, which could free up tens of billions of dollars in oil and gas revenue and boost Iran's struggling economy. And with energy prices skyrocketing following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a resurrected nuclear deal would help lower prices and pour more barrels into Europe.",

            "Five days later, Wang was released and told to leave Mexico within 20 days. He then paid a smuggler thousands of dollars to get to Mexico City. He was squeezed into the back of a truck with dozens of migrants, so crowded that he could hardly move or stretch his legs -- then into a hot van with two dozen other people, with sealed windows and no air conditioning.",
            "It was more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit inside the van, Wang said, and as sweat poured out of him, he struggled to breathe.",

For trucks moving along a key transport corridor, stretching from Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Durban, South Africa, the river was an obstacle without an elegant solution. Vehicles would load onto a pontoon, two at a time, when the current wasn't too strong and the rains not too heavy. It was a 10 to 15-minute journey that you could spend up to 15 days waiting for, recalls the head of one truck drivers' association.",
            "Today, the pontoons sit ashore, mercifully redundant. You might spot them while crossing the 923-meter (3,028-foot) long Kazungula Bridge, a $260 million project co-financed and co-operated by Botswana and Zambia, that a year into service has already transformed this southern African trade artery.",
            "The bridge was conceived to speed up travel along the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) North-South Corridor, a route historically beset with costly border delays.",
            "Copper from DRC, Zambia and Tanzania traveling south before being shipped to China. Food from South Africa traveling north. Mining equipment from Tanzania heading to the DRC and Zambia. All pass across Kazungula, says Kaiko Salim Wamunyima, secretary general of the SADC Truck Drivers Association of Zambia.",
            "The bridge opened in May 2021 but was over a decade in the making, explains Kazungula project engineering manager Isaac Chifunda.",
            "Geopolitics played a large part in the bridge's design. Kazungula spans an area of Africa known as the \"quadripoint,\" says Chifunda. Sixty-five kilometers (40 miles) upstream from Victoria Falls, Botswana, Zambia, Namibia and Zimbabwe converge at the confluence of the Zambezi and Chobe rivers. The countries' borders extend into the rivers, so Kazungula Bridge was shaped with a pronounced curve to weave through the landscape, avoiding Zimbabwean waters, says Chifunda.",
            "\"Africa was massively represented on this project,\" says Chifunda. Although construction was overseen by South Korean company Daewoo E&C, the team was multinational, he says, and raw materials including cement, steel and aggregates came from across southern Africa.",
            "As a significant investment for Zambia and Botswana, the bridge is packed with technology to ensure its long-term future.",
            "Chifunda explains that a structural health monitoring system \"gives signals to which part of the bridge needs maintenance. And we also have a weather station -- we measure wind speed, rainfall, we even measure excitation, that is, the movement of the (suspension) cables.",
            "\"If there is danger, the station will send a signal through a message on the phone, through email as well, so that the two member states can attend to any maintenance needs.\"",
            "New customs",
            "At either end of the bridge are one-stop customs offices, so freight crossing the border only needs processing by one country. Expediency is necessary now that there is a higher volume of daily traffic.",
            "Chikumbi Chama, assistant commissioner at the Zambia Revenue Authority, says the bridge has allowed longer operating hours, with the border open between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. The old border facility received up to 80 trucks a day, now customs is receiving over 280, she adds, and \"the numbers are rising every day.\" But despite the higher volume of traffic, \"(the) transit period has been reduced to half a day.\"",
            "Truck driver Memory Lambie criss-crosses the region with a sign reading \"BOSS LADY\" in her windscreen. Nevertheless, she remembers the \"big challenge\" crossing the Zambezi before the bridge; 10-kilometer queues at the border and up to two weeks waiting to get into Zambia. \"Now it's easy,\" Lambie says, adding with the faster journeys, she's able to spend more time with her children.",
            "Keeping the wheels in motion",
            "A year after opening, the bridge is yet to realize its full potential, because the train line that runs through its center is not yet operational.",
            "The rail link is intended for both passengers and freight, says Chifunda, the project engineer, but crossings won't run simultaneously with cars and trucks. \"The bridge has been designed in such a way that the train and the vehicles cannot use the bridge at the same time,\" he explains. Vehicle traffic is cleared, then a train crosses, then vehicle traffic can resume.",
            "Once connected to existing rail infrastructure in Botswana and Zambia, an even higher volume of cargo will be able to travel across the bridge and around southern Africa, says Chama.",
            "This will likely bring down cargo transport costs. A 2015 African Development Bank report identified poor rail links in landlocked countries (like Botswana and Zambia) as limiting their economic potential. Diesel-powered rail freight can be up to 75% cheaper than road freight, yet roads still handle the overwhelming majority of cargo in the SADC.",
            "\"In the future landscape, I see rail cargo becoming a prominent feature,\" Chama adds. But a timeline for when the bridge will be fully connected is unclear, with talks between Botswana and Zambia ongoing, says Chifunda.",
            "In the meantime, trucks continue to pass back and forth across the Zambezi River, with greater haste and ease than ever before. For drivers like Lambie, it has already proved a revelation. \"The bridge is 100% perfect to us,\" she says."

            "The charges filed against her by the Public Prosecution included \"providing succor to those seeking to disrupt public order and undermine the safety of the general public and stability of the state, and publishing false and tendentious rumors on Twitter,\" ALQST said.",

            "Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.",
            "(CNN)A tiny fish that lives in the icy waters off the coast of Greenland may be unassumingly small, but scientists have found it's exceptional in more ways than one.",
            "The variegated snailfish is full of naturally occurring antifreeze proteins at previously unseen levels that help it survive in subzero waters, according to new research. The snailfish, known as Liparis gibbus, is also distinctive thanks to biofluorescence, which makes it glow in green and red.",
            "Study authors David Gruber and John Sparks, both research scientists at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, were on the Constantine S. Niarchos Scientific Expedition in 2019 when they spied a glowing snailfish off the coast of East Greenland.",
            "Biofluorescence occurs when animals have the ability to convert blue light into green, red or yellow light. This trait is incredibly rare in Arctic fish, who live in extended periods of darkness. So far, the variegated snailfish is the only known polar fish to have this glow.",
            "Gruber and Sparks collected a juvenile snailfish only about 3/4 inch (1.9 centimeters) long -- about the size of a fingernail -- compared with the average 4.5-inch (11.4-centimeter) length of an adult.",
            "The scientists wanted to learn more about the snailfish's biofluorescent properties when they stumbled on something else in the fish's genetics: the highest expression levels of antifreeze proteins ever observed.",
            "\"Similar to how antifreeze in your car keeps the water in your radiator from freezing in cold temperatures, some animals have evolved amazing machinery that prevent them from freezing, such as antifreeze proteins, which prevent ice crystals from forming,\" said Gruber, a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History and distinguished professor of biology at the City University of New York's Baruch College, in a statement.",
            "\"We already knew that this tiny snailfish, which lives in extremely cold waters, produced antifreeze proteins, but we didn't realize just how chock-full of those proteins it is -- and the amount of effort it was putting into making these proteins.\"",
            "As Arctic waters continue to warm due to the climate crisis, however, the future of the variegated snailfish, with its remarkable adaptation to the cold, is uncertain, said study coauthor John Burns, senior research scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine.",
            "The journal Evolutionary Bioinformatics published the findings on Tuesday.",
            "Polar oceans are extreme environments for marine life and only creatures who have adapted to live within the freezing temperatures can survive there.",
            "Some species of insects and reptiles can survive if they experience partial freezing of their body fluids, but fish can't. Antifreeze proteins, produced largely in the liver, prevent large ice grains from forming in their cells and body fluids.",
            "Scientists first discovered antifreeze proteins in fish almost 50 years ago. Researchers traced back the proteins to five different genetic families.",
            "The snailfish is particularly intriguing because it has two different types of gene families that encode the antifreeze proteins: type I and type IV.",
            "\"The genes coding for type I antifreeze proteins are likely recent additions to the fish genome and may be actively expanding to additional copies,\" Burns said. \"It's like catching evolution in action.\"",
            "The fact that the scientists uncovered so much genetic detail in one juvenile snailfish captures what happens as the fish grows and develops, Burns said.",
            "\"We see that in addition to growth, this juvenile fish must also invest heavily in protecting itself from freezing,\" Burns said. \"The amount of RNA the fish is making for protection from freezing is on par with what it invests in fundamental cellular machinery, the stuff that makes its cells in the first place.\"",
            "So far, scientists don't know if there is a link between the biofluorescence and antifreeze proteins.",
            "But warming temperatures in the Arctic could pose a threat to the very creatures who have adapted to survive there -- meaning that all of the energy they put into protection from freezing is wasted effort, Burns said.",
            "Some scientists predict that if Arctic sea ice continues to decline at its current rate, the Arctic will be ice-free within the next three decades, according to the study authors.",
            "\"Arctic seas do not support a high diversity of fish species, and our study hypothesizes that with increasingly warming oceanic temperatures, ice-dwelling specialists such as this snailfish may encounter increased competition by more temperate species that were previously unable to survive at these higher northern latitudes,\" said Sparks, a curator in the American Museum of Natural History's department of ichthyology and professor at the museum's Richard Gilder Graduate School, in a statement.",
            "Understanding more about antifreeze proteins could help scientists translate their findings into biotech uses, like protecting crops from frost or better determining the freezing properties of meat, Burns said."

            "The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information with the media.",
            "The report describes the Saki airbase, which was rocked by explosions last Tuesday, as a hard but one time loss for Russian military infrastructure in the peninsula, with subsequent attacks as proof of Ukraine's systematic military capability in targeting Crimea.",
            "The August 9 incident at Saki airbase, which destroyed at least seven military aircraft, severely damaged the base and killed at least one person .",
            "Russia claimed it was a result of an accident and Ukrainian officials have so far declined to confirm on the record that they were responsible. What caused the explosions remains unclear.",
            "In a speech following the incident, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the war \"began with Crimea and must end with Crimea -- its liberation.\"",
            "Another set of explosions were reported in Crimea this week, on August 16, this time at an ammunition depot in Maiske and at an airfield in Gvardeyskoe.",

            "On Tuesday, a fire and smoke plume were seen rising from an electrical substation 12 miles away from Maiske's ammunition depot, according to social media footage. The cause of the fire, and smoke, at the substation remains unclear.",
            "The incidents both took place around the Dzhankoi area, described by the British Ministry of Defence as \"a key road and rail junction that plays an important role in supplying Russia's operations in southern Ukraine.\"",

            "Over the weekend, Ukrainian officials said that a railway bridge near the southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, used by Russians to transport military equipment and weapons from occupied Crimea, was blown up by Ukrainian partisans. Melitopol has for months been a center of underground resistance to Russian occupation.",
            "As analysts speculate that there is a campaign to degrade Russia's military capability in Crimea, Zelensky warned Ukrainians living in occupied areas on Tuesday to stay clear of Russian forces' military facilities.",
            "What do the blasts mean for Putin's ambitions?",
            "The explosions at Saki airbase jolted sunbathers lounging in beach-side cabanas last week, and marked the start of a series of mysterious incidents on the Ukrainian peninsula that threatens the jewel of President Vladimir Putin's revanchist ambitions.",
            "Western officials and analysts have since offered competing explanations about the cause.",
            "In any event, the Cavell Group said, the \"Saki attack was audacious and highly effective in both damaging Russian reinforcements and striking a significant psychological blow to morale amongst the Russian military and civilians.\"",
            "Whatever caused the explosions, they could have significant implications for the overall conflict, especially if the attack were to have been carried out with any new long-range weapon system that Ukraine has developed.",
            "The UK Ministry of Defence says that the loss of combat jets represents a minor proportion of the overall fleet of aircraft Russia has available to support the war.",
            "But it noted that Saki is the main base for supporting the Russian navy in the Black Sea. \"The fleet's naval aviation capability is now significantly degraded. The incident will likely prompt the Russian military to revise its threat perception,\" it said.",
            "It may also cause a re-evaluation of the threat to Crimea which \"has probably been seen as a secure rear-area,\" the ministry said.",
            "Why is Crimea so important to Putin?",
            "Crimea is home to Russia's Black Sea Fleet, which is based at Sevastopol. The peninsula has acted as a launching pad for the February invasion, with Russian troops pouring into Ukraine's south from the annexed region.",
            "Control of Crimea assures Russia continuing access to the Sevastopol naval base, which it previously operated under a leasing deal with Ukraine that was scrapped after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Surrounded by the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, ships and submarines based in Crimea are just north of Turkey and can reach the Mediterranean to influence the Middle East and the Balkans.",
            "Crimea was forcibly seized by Russia in 2014 -- soon after Ukrainian protesters helped topple pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych -- when thousands of Russian special-operations troops wearing unmarked uniforms deployed around the peninsula in early March that year.",
            "Two weeks later, Russia completed its annexation of Crimea in a referendum, slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate, and at the time considered the biggest land-grab on Europe since World War II.",
            "Since annexation, human-rights observers have described Crimea's descent into a police state, with local authorities and Russian security services persecuting and arresting those perceived to be loyal to Ukraine, including members of the Crimean Tatar community. A 2020 US State Deparment report described a pattern of \"unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by Russia or Russia-led \"authorities\"; forced disappearances by Russia or Russia-led \"authorities\"; torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment\" in Crimea.",
            "Even before annexation, nationalist Russian politicians often made claims to the region -- with its rich farmland and its access to the Black Sea -- part of their populist rhetoric, even though Russia was just one of a number of powers to have dominated Crimea over the centuries. One particular nationalist grievance was the Soviet leadership's decision to transfer the administration of Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, when both Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union.",
            "Putin also capitalized on those sentiments.",
            "\"In our hearts, we know Crimea has always been an inalienable part of Russia,\" Putin told Russian lawmakers as he announced the annexation in 2014.",
            "Crimea has long been a popular spot for Russian vacationers and for the Soviet elite. In 1991, the Soviet Union's last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, was vacationing in the region when hardliners launched a coup against him.",
            "The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia has affected tourism in the region. Sergei Aksyonov, the head of the Russian-controlled Crimean administration, acknowledged last month that a 40% decline in the tourism industry was expected over the summer. The Russian Tourism Association made a similar prediction in June.",
            "Despite Moscow's claims, domestic politics may have played a part in Putin's decision to annex the region. Despite an economic crisis in Russia, nationalistic rhetoric and Crimea's invasion saw Putin's approval ratings climb in 2014",
            "What's happened in Crimea after the blasts?",
            "The Russian road state agency on Tuesday reported a new traffic record across a Crimean bridge just days after the explosions at Saki airbase.",
            "\"During the day on August 15, 38,297 cars drove across the bridge in both directions,\" the statement read.",
            "Local officials have downplayed the size of the lines saying they were the result of stricter controls on the bridge for security reasons and not because of an increase in outward traffic.",
            "\"From the point of view that they are fleeing Crimea, this is a complete lie, there is no doubt about it,\" Aksyonov, the head of the Russian-controlled Crimean administration, told Russian state TV on Tuesday.",
            "On Tuesday, in reference to the miles-long tailbacks of civilian vehicles attempted to leave Crimea for Russia, Zelensky said: \"The queue these days to leave Crimea for Russia via the bridge proves that the absolute majority of citizens of the terrorist state already understand or at least feel that Crimea is not a place for them.\""
