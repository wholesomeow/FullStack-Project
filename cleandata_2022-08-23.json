            "It's a development that could make a breakthrough more likely after Tehran dropped another key request last week.",
            "Iran had previously demanded that as a condition of re-entering the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the International Atomic Energy Agency had to close its investigation of undeclared nuclear material found at Iranian sites in 2019. But Iran has now dropped that demand, the senior administration official said on Tuesday.",
            "The official said that \"reports that we have accepted or are considering new concessions to Iran as part of reentering the 2015 nuclear deal are categorically false. It is Iran that has made concessions on critical issues.\"\nReuters first reported the development.",
            "As CNN reported last week, Iran has also officially dropped its longtime demand that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps be removed from the State Department's list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The Iranians also dropped demands related to delisting several companies tied to the IRGC, CNN reported. The Trump administration designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization in 2019 as part of a \"maximum pressure campaign\" imposed after Trump withdrew the US from the deal in 2018.",
            "Neither demands regarding the IRGC or the IAEA probes were included in the text of Iran's response last week to a draft nuclear deal agreement proposed by the European Union, officials said. It is possible, however, that if Iran cooperates with the open IAEA investigation prior to the signing of a new deal, that investigation could technically be closed by the time an agreement is officially reached.",
            "The US had insisted during negotiations both that the IRGC remain on the list and that the IAEA be allowed to continue its investigations, so the Biden administration views the Iranian draft response as a significant concession. It is not clear whether Iran has maintained its third key demand, which is that the deal include a mechanism by which Tehran would be compensated should a future US president pull out of the deal.",
            "IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told CNN on Monday that the agency would \"absolutely not\" close its probes, noting that \"so far Iran has not given us the technically credible explanations we need to explain origin of many traces of uranium, the presence of equipment at places.\"",
            "\"This idea that politically we are going to stop doing our job is unacceptable for us,\" Grossi added.",
            "In June, Iran retaliated against the IAEA probe by removing surveillance cameras at key nuclear sites, which prohibited inspectors and negotiators from obtaining timely information on the country's uranium enrichment program.",
            "That camera has still not been turned back on\u2014and the senior administration official told CNN that if Iran wants back into the deal, it will have to agree to \"comprehensive inspections\" by the IAEA.",
            "\"Should we reach an agreement to return to the deal, Iran would have to take many significant steps to dismantle its nuclear program,\" the official said, including allowing the IAEA \"to implement the most comprehensive inspections regime ever negotiated, allowing it to detect any Iranian effort to pursue a nuclear weapon covertly. Much of that international monitoring would remain in place for an unlimited amount of time.\"",
            "Iran would also be prohibited from enriching and stockpiling uranium above very limited levels, denying it has the material required for a bomb, the official said, and would not be allowed to maintain \"the 20 and 60%-enriched uranium that it is stockpiling today.\"",
            "A deal would also require the removal of \"thousands of advanced centrifuges\" that Iran is operating, the official said, \"including all of the centrifuges enriching at the fortified underground facility at Fordow. Strict limits on Iranian enrichment would mean that even if Iran left the deal to pursue a nuclear weapon, it would take at least six months to do so.\"",
            "On Monday, the US State Department spokesperson expressed optimism about the prospects for reviving the deal.",
            "\"A deal is closer now than it was two weeks ago, but the outcome of these ongoing discussions still remains uncertain as gaps do remain,\" Ned Price said at a State Department briefing."

He emerged from fringe politics, most notably as founding member of the National Bolshevik party, political provocateurs who combined communist and fascist symbolism with a heaping dose of anti-Western sentiment. There are differing opinions on his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin now, though the ultranationalist's teachings were in line with Putin's expansionism, and Dugin is a fierce proponent of Russia's war in Ukraine.",

Putin's rise on New Year's Eve, 1999, ushered in a new social contract: Russia would see an end to its criminal lawlessness, and in exchange, Russians accepted a form of authoritarian rule. The bandits no longer ruled Russia \u2014 Putin's security services did.

        "Content": [
            "Sea of Galilee, Israel Despite its name, the Sea of Galilee in northern Israel is actually a freshwater lake, and it's one that has sustained life for millennia. Even today, the lake irrigates vineyards and local farms that grow everything from green vegetables to wheat and tangerines. Its archeology, hot springs and hiking trails bring tourism and livelihoods for local communities.",
            "But this place of religious pilgrimage \u2014 where the New Testament says many of Jesus' miracles were performed \u2014 is facing a bleak future. The climate crisis is causing huge fluctuations in the lake's water levels. Now it happens to be fairly full, but just five years ago, it hit a record low.",
            "Climate change and unsustainable water management are leaving lakes dried up all over the Middle East and beyond, but the Israeli government is hopeful it has a solution: It plans to pump water from the Mediterranean sea, take the salt out of it and send it across the country to top up the lake when needed.",
            "It's a dramatic change for the Sea of Galilee, called the Kinneret in Hebrew, which once pumped out nearly all of Israel's drinkable water. The water will now flow in the opposition direction.",
            "Israel has plenty of expertise in desalination. As a water-insecure nation, it has for more than two decades been taking seawater from the Mediterranean and treating it through a process called reverse osmosis, essentially taking the salt out of the water to make it drinkable. It's a process that other parts of the world, including California, have turned to in times of drought, but in Israel, it's an everyday reality. Five desalination plants along the coast now provide nearly all the tap water for the country's 9.2 million people.",
            "One problem is that these plants tend to run on natural gas, a fossil fuel that contributes to the climate crisis, which only worsens the extreme weather that is causing the lake's water levels to fluctuate in the first place. But in time, as grids transition to greener energy sources, Israel's solution may become more attractive.",
            "The new project looks a little underwhelming \u2014 a 1.6-meter-wide water pipe laid across 31 kilometers \u2014 but it's the first of its kind. It will take the desalinated water and pump it through the Tsalmon stream that feeds the lake.",
            "When he first heard of the project, Noam Ben Shoa, head engineer at Israel's national water company, Mekorot, thought it was a strange idea.",
            "\"But very soon, we understood the value it has to the national market itself,\" he told CNN at a construction site for the pipe.",
            "It also helps with the development of agriculture in the wider region, he said, as well as relations with neighboring Jordan.",
            "Israel has a long standing agreement with Jordan to sell tens of millions of cubic meters of water annually to the kingdom. In 2021, the two countries signed a new agreement where Jordan would receive 200 million cubic meters of desalinated water a year from Israel \u2014 about 20% of Jordan's water needs \u2014 in return for solar energy to help power Israel's electric grid. Emirati companies would build 600 solar power plants in Jordan to generate the energy.",
            "Within months, the new $264 million pipeline is expected to be functional, and will be able to move 120 million square meters of water per year, but will only pump to the lake when necessary, Ben Shoa said.",
            "\"The uniqueness of this project is that it gives us almost infinite flexibility,\" he said. \"We can basically take the water where it is available ... and just divert it and transport it to wherever it is needed. In the population centers, for agricultural or industrial uses as well.\"",
            "Getting ahead of the crisis",
            "The need to do things radically differently hit home during the most recent, five-year drought, which ended in 2018. Despite a ban on pumping water from the lake, water levels here still reached a record low. But it's also what's to come with the worsening climate crisis that has pushed Israel's water authority to intervene now.",
            "\"They looked into the future climate change, and what's going to happen [with] rainfall in this area, and also looked at the increase in population and projected increase in demand of water,\" Gideon Gal, senior scientist and head of the Kinneret Limnological Laboratory, told CNN. \"And they realized that 30, 40 years from now, there's going to be a serious problem in maintaining [water] levels in the lake, and maintaining water quality unless something is done.\"",
            "But that something had never been done before. Even if salt is removed, the makeup of the water is also different in other ways, Gal said.",
            "\"When you mix desalinated water with natural water, you see an impact on the biology in the experiments,\" Gal said. \"We'll be bringing things to the lake that may not exist naturally.\"",
            "But so far, Gal says their experiments show the new water won't cause a huge impact on existing species. In fact, it may even help the lake combat the effects of climate change by causing a higher rate of water turnover, which helps prevent too much bacterial growth, and could help cool the water's temperatures.",
            "Even with the potential benefits, Gal said he wished the lake didn't need any human intervention.",
            "\"But given what we think we know about climate change, and what's going to happen in the lake,\" Gal said. \"The risk of introducing desalinated water is a risk that is worthwhile taking.\""

The Iranian city of Abadan set the record for the hottest dry heat temperature this year when it hit 53 degrees Celsius (127 degrees Fahrenheit) on August 5. But combine that with the high levels of humidity in the region and it becomes an even more inhospitable place for human beings. It's harder to cool down when the weather is humid, as our bodies struggle to transfer their heat to \"wet\" air rather than dry air, making it harder to sweat it out and lower our body temperatures.",

            "For many, Colombia is synonymous with drug cartels and narco-traffickers. It is one of the largest narcotics producers in the world -- last year, the US government estimated was producing over one million kilograms of cocaine, the highest in the world and more than the two closest nations, Peru and Bolivia, combined. So when the South American country's new president says he intends to regulate the use of illegal substances -- or at least some of them -- the world listens.",
            "\"It is time to accept that the war on drugs has been a complete failure,\" Colombian President Gustavo Petro announced during his inauguration festivities earlier this month, commenting on a bill his administration recently presented to legalize recreational marijuana to Congress.",
            "Colombia's law already allows the production of cannabis for medical purposes, mostly to be exported to foreign markets like the United States and Canada, but supporters of the new legislation believe that only legalizing recreational cannabis can push thousands of farmers away from drug trafficking and into the legal trade.",
            "To this day, the Colombian state faces challenges over control of its territory by a variety of criminal actors, from former left-wing guerrillas and paramilitaries to narco-cartels and organized crime syndicates. Drug trafficking is a powerful source of revenue for these outlaws, and over the past 50 years public authorities have pushed a prohibitionist agenda, banning the trade and consumption of drugs in order to hit the criminals in their pockets. But the stream of illegal drugs never ceased.",
            "\"We will never achieve peace in Colombia until we regulate drug trafficking,\" said Senator Gustavo Bolivar, one of the signatories of the new bill and a close ally of the new president.",
            "\"Not even the United States, with all their might and money, could win the war on drugs... Right now, Colombia produces more drugs than when Pablo Escobar was alive, there are more consumers, more farmers. The drug trade is growing despite the money we invest in fighting it, and the thousands of deaths we suffer,\" said Bolivar, who recently traveled to Colorado for a firsthand look at the economic benefits of legalizing weed.",
            "In an interview, Bolivar told CNN it was hypocritical of the United States to legalize marijuana at home, and supporting drug wars abroad such as in Colombia, where Washington sends millions of dollars every year to arm and train Colombian forces in their struggle against the cartels.",
            "A landmark report from the Truth Commission, an interdisciplinary panel tasked to investigate over 50 years of civil conflict in Colombia, found that drug trafficking helped prolong the conflict despite almost $8 billion in military aid from the US to Colombia. At least 260,000 Colombians, the vast majority civilians, were killed in the violence.",
            "A new generation of Colombian leaders",
            "The campaign to legalize weed in Colombia unites left-wing senators like Bolivar with civil society organizations and deep-pocketed foreign investors, and has received a boost over the last 12 months from the country's changing politics, with Petro ascending to the presidency and progressive parties now a majority in Colombian congress.",
            "\"We saw the legalization of adult-use recreational two, three, or four years down the line... but now we're hoping for this year,\" said Luis Merchan, a Colombian businessman who is the CEO of Flora Growth, a Toronto-based company that is investing in Colombian marijuana from medical cannabis to textile hemp.",
            "The campaigners who have demanded this shift for years agree.",
            "\"We think now the time is ripe to do it,\" says Luis Felipe Ruiz, an investigator at Colombia's NGO Dejusticia, which supports decriminalizing drugs and has documented the war on drugs for years. Drug trafficking is the top cause of detention in Colombia and, according to the Colombian Justice Ministry, 13% of the country's detainees are serving a sentence related to the drug trade. Ruiz argues that one of the benefits of legalizing marijuana would also be decreasing the prison population in the country.",
            "\"There's a large part of the political world that is ready to have a debate on legalizing marijuana and, frankly, taking away the stigma against cannabis is already a great victory for us,\" Ruiz told CNN.",
            "Those who oppose legalization hail from the conservative right and believe the shift would just make drug abuse easier. Former President Alvaro Uribe, a political mentor of Petro's predecessor Ivan Duque and the main exponent of conservativism in the country, tweeted in 2020 that \"recreational marijuana leads to other drugs, alters the neurons, the consumer reaches states of alienation, loses control over his decisions, which is the loss of his freedom,\" celebrating when a previous project to legalize weed was blocked in Congress.",
            "Illegal agriculture",
            "Historically, marijuana in Colombia is grown by small-scale farmers who cannot afford the pharmaceutical licenses required to produce medical cannabis, so they sell their product to drug cartels.",
            "The bill presented to Congress could allow these small-scale farmers, most of them based in chronically underdeveloped rural regions of Colombia, to finally enter the legal market.",
            "COCCAM, a confederation of coca, marijuana and poppy growers that works as a lobbying group for illicit farmers, estimates that up to 3,000 families depend on illegal marijuana as a main source of their income, mostly in the southwestern department of Cauca. In most cases, these farmers live in isolated rural areas that are hours away from the closest paved road.",
            "Compared to legal agricultural products like fruit and vegetables, marijuana and coca leaves don't spoil for days and sell at a higher price per kilogram. They also have the advantage of growing all-year round, while most plants give a harvest only a few months a year.",
            "Because of Colombia's historic role, legalizing recreational use would be an immense cultural shift -- and perhaps a source of pride, Marchan said.",
            "\"It would be not only a source of pride for someone like me for what was frowned upon: I have been in business for a number of decades and when somebody learns that I'm from Colombia you always get the 'ahh,' that weird look,\" he said.",
            "Legal cocaine?",
            "Bolivar, the senator, believes the Colombian regulatory system will, eventually, follow the same path by legalizing not only marijuana but even cocaine -- the most lucrative source of income for the cartels.",
            "Drafting numbers on an illegal market is never an exact science, but a 2016 study from the Colombian government estimated that drug trafficking -- the flow of illegal drugs, mostly cocaine, that is produced in Colombia and sold in international markets from Europe, to North America, to Asia -- was worth up to 3.8% of the Colombian GDP or $7.5 million at the time.",
            "In comparison, illegal drug consumption -- intended as the drugs that are consumed illegally in Colombia and where marijuana plays a larger role -- was worth 0.75% of the Colombian GDP -- $2.18 million.",
            "\"Marijuana is small change in the drug business. The big money that the cartels are making, and the lion's share of the problem, is called cocaine. And people in Colombia and Mexico will continue to die as long as we look at the problem with hypocrisy,\" Bolivar told CNN.",
            "He envisions a network of state-regulated dispensaries where cocaine could be sold under medical prescription, and regional agreements across other drug producing countries. The three largest producers of cocaine in the world -- Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru -- are all currently ruled by ideologically aligned, left-wing leaders. Bolivia has a thriving legal market of coca byproducts, mostly dry leaves that are chewed by the indigenous population and already in 2012, the governments of Bolivia and Colombia pushed for a regional re-thinking of drug policies in multilateral meetings.",
            "\"We could for example make a small treaty in our countries to modify the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs and plant the first flag of legalization in the world; other countries may follow,\" the senator said.",
            "But before international treaties are rewritten, Colombia might still have a legal battle ahead of it. As it stands, the Colombian constitution explicitly forbids using narcotic drugs without medical prescription; so even if Congress passed a law legalizing recreational marijuana, it could be deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.",
            "An appeal to eliminate that article has already started by another lawmaker, Congressman Juan Carlos Losada.",
            "\"It's a two-front battle. Our legalizing bill in Congress, and the appeal by Losada to the constitutional court. Whichever comes first we will support it, because this country needs peace,\" said Bolivar."

            "The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country \u2014 and 97% of cities \u2014 exceeded the World Health Organization's air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health.",
            "Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO's standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.",
            "India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times.",
            "The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.",
            "In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.",
            "\"This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,\" Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. \"(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.\"",
            "Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir.",
            "It's the first major global air quality report based on WHO's new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter \u2014 or PM 2.5 \u2014 from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.",
            "PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.",
            "Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.",
            "IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.",
            "In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed.",
            "\"The (United States') reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,\" the authors wrote.",
            "Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country's most vulnerable and marginalized communities.",
            "\"We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,\" said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. \"We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we're still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we're seeing in major cities.\"",
            "Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution \u2014 including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July.",
            "China \u2014 which is among the countries with the worst air pollution \u2014 showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city.",
            "The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world's major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change.",
            "\"This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.\" Hammes said.",
            "The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.",
            "\"When you don't have that data, you're really in the dark,\" Hammes said.",
            "Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country's air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh.",
            "Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.",
            "\"I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,\" Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. \"However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.\"",

            "As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.",
            "The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.",
            "At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store's parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers' cars cool on hot, sunny days.)",
            "As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.",
            "Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.",
            "Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.",
            "The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That's roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.",
            "\"Every rooftop in America that isn't producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,\" Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America's campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. \"Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there's no better place than the roofs of America's big-box superstores.\"",
            "Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.",
            "Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report's authors told CNN.",
            "CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers \u2014 Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target \u2014 to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?",
            "Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks \u2014 regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves \u2014 that are preventing more widespread adoption.",
            "The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming \"unquestionably urgent\" as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.",
            "\"We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,\" Cowen told CNN. \"I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There's still a tremendous amount of work to do.\"",
            "What's the holdup?",
            "Neumann said Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space \u2014 an area larger than Manhattan \u2014 and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.",
            "It's enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.",
            "Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.",
            "Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it's aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.",
            "\"Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,\" Neumann told CNN. \"And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.\"",
            "According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company's installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location's electricity needs.",
            "Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association's most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar \u2014 around a quarter of the company's stores \u2014 a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties' energy needs, the spokesperson said.",
            "Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.",
            "Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.",
            "\"My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,\" Neumann said. \"Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.\"",
            "Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D'Arcy, the company's director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores' energy needs on average, he said.",
            "Aging rooftops at stores are a \"huge impediment\" to solar installation, D'Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn't make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.",
            "\"We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,\" D'Arcy told CNN.",
            "CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties \u2014 stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants \u2014 with solar installations. One of the \"multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation\" was the stores' ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.",
            "Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.",
            "\"For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,\" Cowen said. \"It's just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.\"",
            "Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has \"failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.\" The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because \"our system is so disjointed\" and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.",
            "\"Why aren't we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,\" Casten told CNN. \"For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn't want to lose the load.",
            "\"We could have done this decades ago,\" Casten added. \"And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we'd also have a lot more money in our pocket.\"",
            "Acting on climate, equitably",
            "For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.",
            "Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels \u2014 and it's doable, Callaway told CNN.",
            "The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.",
            "In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.",
            "\"One of my huge concerns is social equity,\" Cowen said. \"Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we've got to figure out ways to make that not true.\"",
            "Jasmine Graham, WE ACT's energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only \"if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.\"",
            "Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.",
            "Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.",
            "\"The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we'll have cleaner air, the sooner we'll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we'll have a more livable future for our kids,\" Neumann said. \"And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.\""

            "The death of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultranationalist firebrand Alexander Dugin, is at first glance a flashback to 1990s Russia, when gangsters settled scores with contract killings and car bombs.",
            "Dugin is a creature of the same decade. He emerged from fringe politics, most notably as founding member of the National Bolshevik party, political provocateurs who combined communist and fascist symbolism with a heaping dose of anti-Western sentiment. There are differing opinions on his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin now, though the ultranationalist's teachings were in line with Putin's expansionism, and Dugin is a fierce proponent of Russia's war in Ukraine.",
            "But Russia today is a very different place from the gangsterism of the 1990s. Putin's rise on New Year's Eve, 1999, ushered in a new social contract: Russia would see an end to its criminal lawlessness, and in exchange, Russians accepted a form of authoritarian rule. The bandits no longer ruled Russia \u2014 Putin's security services did. That didn't mean that assassinations were no longer a feature of Russia's political landscape: It's just that they were typically carried out against those who challenged Putin's authority.",
            "Regardless of who is behind the killing, or whether Dugina or her father was the real target, the bombing could mark a shift in the pattern of modern-day Russian political killings.",
            "Decades of suspicious deaths",
            "Over the two decades of Putin's rule, many of his most prominent opponents have met violent ends.",
            "One of the first such cases was the murder of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya. She was shot dead in the stairwell of her apartment building \u2014 on Putin's birthday. Arrests and convictions followed, but her colleagues still insist that those responsible for the killing were never brought to justice.",
            "Then there was the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, a former agent of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who had emerged as a prominent critic of Putin. Litvinenko died in 2006 after his tea was dosed with highly radioactive polonium-216. In a deathbed statement, Litvinenko blamed Putin; the European Court of Human Rights and a British inquiry said Russian agents administered the fatal poison.",
            "Russian society was rocked in 2015 by the assassination of the politician Boris Nemtsov. The political figure, an outspoken critic of Putin's involvement in the war in Ukraine's Donbas region, was gunned down in view of the Kremlin.",
            "The list goes on. Alexey Navalny, who in many respects inherited the mantle of opposition leader from Nemtsov, is currently serving in a Russian penal colony. He survived poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok, something he blames on Russia's security services.",
            "The car bombing that killed Dugina has more than faint resemblance to the murky killings of a string of pro-Russian separatist leaders in the Donbas region in the years leading up to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.",
            "In many of those cases, such as the cafe bombing that killed Donetsk separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko, Russian officials blamed the assassinations on Ukrainian spies or saboteurs. Many observers, however, suspected those killings were just as likely to have been the Russian security services getting rid of troublesome separatist leaders who were too difficult to control.",
            "Another possible explanation could be that the assassinations were actually linked to business disputes that had been settled in classic gangster fashion.",
            "Though we do not know who was behind this attack, what's certain is the Russian government will find a way to capitalize on it.",
            "The Kremlin has already seized on Dugina's killing to blame an external enemy -- Ukraine \u2014 with the FSB on Monday claiming it had cracked the Dugina case and accusing Ukrainian special services of involvement, state-run media TASS reported.",

            "It's a world of the unknown, but in some tropical and subtropical waters coral reefs thrive. Very few scientists have ventured to these deep reefs, known technically as mesophotic coral ecosystems, meaning \"middle light,\" and many assumed that the lack of light and chilly temperatures meant few species could exist there.",
            "But one scientist has been diving into the inky depths to show there's much more to life there than was first thought.",
            "\"When you get up close, it's a very colorful ecosystem,\" says Luiz Rocha, Brazilian ichthyologist (a person who studies fish) and co-director of the Hope for Reefs initiative at the California Academy of Sciences. \"There's many different kinds of fish and many of them are unknown.\"",
            "Rocha, whose studies focus on ocean life between 200 and 500 feet deep, was attracted to twilight zone reefs because of their mystery. \"Every dive we do to those depths (leads to) a new discovery,\" he says.",
            "To date, he has identified around 30 new species -- from a purple fairy wrasse named after the mythical nation of Wakanda, to the Tosanoides aphrodite, a pink and yellow reef fish named after the Greek goddess of love. But his deep-sea explorations have also proven that these reefs and the rainbow-hued species that roam them are under threat. His mission is to protect them.",

            "Entering the twilight zone is no easy feat. While it could be reached by submarine, this would be a clumsy way to study fish that flit in and out the shadows, says Rocha, comparing it to studying birds in a rainforest with a helicopter.",
            "Instead he scuba dives, but the deeper he descends the more dangerous it becomes. Recreational diving is capped at 130 feet for safety reasons, but Rocha dives as far as 500 feet. To do this requires deep concentration, intense technical training and a strong dose of bravery.",
            "\"What really makes this research special is that there's only a handful of scientists in the world doing this,\" he says.",

They spend hours preparing the kit, ensuring every piece of equipment is functioning well and that they are equipped to deal with underwater emergencies. The divers must use rebreathers, which recycle the gas exhaled by the diver, and a special breathing gas containing helium that is safe for deep dives.",
            "Getting down takes just 10 to 15 minutes depending on how steep the reef is, says Rocha, but the ascent can take five to six hours to allow the body to decompress.",
            "All that effort gives him just seven to 10 minutes at maximum depth, where he and his team look for fish, collect DNA samples and record the number of organisms in an area. If they think they have found a new species, they usually catch it and carry it up to the surface in a decompression chamber so they can study the specimen back in the lab.",

            "Despite having done it dozens of times, Rocha still feels the pangs of anxiety before each dive.

When you see something that nobody has ever seen before ... it's absolutely amazing.\"",
            "Human impacts run deep",
            "While the twilight zone has been explored by very few people, the effects of human activity are still apparent.",
            "Previously it was thought that coral reefs in deeper waters could provide a refuge as they are less affected by human development and climate change. But Rocha proved this wrong: \"One of our first discoveries is that those deeper reefs are really not a refuge for shallow reef organisms. They are almost as impacted as the shallow reefs are,\" he says.",
            "He has found plastic trash and fishing gear in some of the deepest reefs and has observed the impact of overfishing and climate change. While there is not yet enough data to determine the scale of the damage compared to shallow reefs, he says it is clear that water temperatures are warming in the deeper zones too and causing reefs to bleach.",
            "Rocha hopes that his research can help to educate people about the twilight zone and inspire action to protect it. He works with policymakers, making the case for marine protected areas where these deep reefs lie. In 2019, the Hope for Reefs initiative was involved in the protection of a coral reef habitat on Maricaban Island in the Philippines, and the year before their research informed the establishment of two protected areas in Brazil.",
            "Related: A shark 'superhighway' is being protected by fishermen",
            "Rocha also works closely with local communities, collaborating with local researchers and giving local names to newly discovered species.

Rocha hopes this will \"give ownership to the local people.\"",
            "Rocha believes that technology will soon advance to a point that gives many more people access to the twilight zone and even more species will be discovered. But his main goal is that when they do, the ecosystems will look the same as they do now.",
            "\"I don't think it's enough just to do the science,\" he says. \"We take many, many photographs ... and we bring those stories back up to the surface and we share it with as many people as possible.\"",

            "The wildfires are another knock-on effect of a crippling heat wave -- China's worst since 1961 -- that has swept through southwestern, central and eastern parts of the country in recent weeks, with temperatures crossing 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in more than 100 cities.",

            "But Russia's invasion has cast a shadow on the happy day. Now educational facilities across the country are racing to build bunkers and bomb shelters for returning students.",
            "As schools prepare to open their doors in September, many educators are grappling with the fact that they don't have the ability to provide safety to pupils, or peace of mind to parents, should their schools come under attack. \"Our schools are not designed to be used as defensive facilities,\" Serhii Horbachov, Ukraine's education ombudsman, told CNN.",
            "In Irpin, a leafy suburb of the capital Kyiv, fighting has wrecked parts of School Number 17, one of the largest in the city that teaches more than 2,400 children aged six to 17. Shrapnel has damaged the school's roof and broken all its windows.",
            "The gaping holes in bright-colored walls and floors of the school have since been fixed with concrete and plaster. With the help of the United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, the school is rebuilding its bomb shelter. \"We make it so that it is safe and comfortable there, and that children are not afraid, and that parents are calm,\" the school's headteacher, Ivan Ptashnyk, told CNN.",
            "Anna Krasiuk, a ninth grader who was visiting the school last Wednesday, told CNN she missed her friends and teachers. \"I really want to go to school ... I dream of hugging my friends and just chatting,\" she said. Beside her, second grader Ivan Pinchuk said all he wanted was for \"Ukraine to win and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to die.\"",
            "Six months since the outbreak of war, children like Krasiuk and Pinchuk are preparing for a new academic year at an enormously challenging moment for the country. Ukraine's armed forces are battling a grinding Russian offensive in the east, and the country's economy is in tatters.",
            "The war has taken an extra toll on kids' lives and prospects. At least 361 children have died since the war began, and 1,072 have been injured, Horbachov said. A June survey by the Ukrainian government estimates 5.7 million school-aged children (between 3 and 18 years old) living in Ukraine have been affected by the war, 2.8 million of whom are estimated to be internally displaced.",
            "At least 6.3 million people have left the country, many of whom are women and children, according to United Nations estimates.",
            "Ukraine, known for its digital innovation, quickly pivoted to online learning as education infrastructure bore the brunt of the Russian offensive. But the lack of technological devices and access to high-speed internet has posed a challenge, according to the June education needs assessment survey, which noted that the education sector needs 203,000 tablets and 165,000 laptops for teachers and students to carry on online learning.",
            "The fighting has damaged 2,300 out of Ukraine's 17,000 schools, according to education officials. Some 59% of all schools and universities will not be ready to resume in-person classes in September, education minister Serhiy Shkarlet said Tuesday, and no one knows how many students will attend in-person classes.",
            "\"The academic year will be very difficult,\" Horbachov said. \"It will begin in unpredictable and very difficult conditions, when there is actually no safe place in Ukraine, since (Russian) missiles can hit anywhere.\"",
            "The knowledge gap",
            "After two years of Covid and half a year of war, educators worry that the knowledge gap is growing among Ukrainian children.",
            "In 2018, the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), seen as an authoritative measure of students' achievement, saw a two-and-a-half year disparity between students in rural areas and their peers in the big cities in Ukraine, said Oksana Matiiash, the head of Teach For Ukraine, an educational non-profit that trains and recruits young teachers to work in schools in low-income communities.",
            "PISA also found the average skills of 15-year-olds in Ukraine were lower than in many EU member states. While there has been no recent assessment since the pandemic, Matiiash said she thinks the learning gaps are extreme: \"A lot of people in Ukraine cannot afford extra help for their children -- tutors, paid academic support -- so I'm afraid to think about the number of months or maybe even years for learning that Ukrainian children have lost.\"",
            "Parents will have to decide if they are comfortable with sending their children back to school. Many are understandably reluctant. Horbachov said those living near the eastern frontlines have opted for online learning due to the constant risk of artillery strikes and air-raid sirens, which have become part of life in many Ukrainian towns and cities.",
            "The last time 11-year-old Zlata Pavlenko spent a full academic year learning in classroom was 2019.",
            "Sitting on a lilac bedspread in her light-filled apartment she shares with her parents in Kyiv, Pavlenko said she began online learning in 2020 due to the pandemic, briefly returning to school for a semester in 2021 before a new wave of the virus forced her and her class to resume studying from home.",
            "Any hope of her returning to the classroom ended when Russia's invasion disrupted every aspect of Ukrainian life, including children's right to an education. Pavlenko fled Kyiv for western Ukraine with her family, only returning in May, but half of her class of 36 students still remains outside the country.",
            "Pavlenko said she really wants to physically attend classes when the term starts on September 1, but her school's bomb shelter can only accommodate a small number of children. Her mother, Hanna Kovalenko, said they will find out in the next few days whether children will have to attend school in shifts based on the shelter's capacity, or if classes will be entirely online.",
            "\"As a mother, it is more difficult for me when the child is studying at home,\" Hanna, who works as an accountant, told CNN. \"Children lack communication (with each other when online learning), so we would like her to study offline.\"",
            "Emotional toll",
            "Socialization is a major part of learning, developing critical thinking skills and problem solving, which is why \"ultimately, we want to see every child back to school and learning in the school environment,\" UNICEF representative Murat Sahin told CNN.",
            "But the war has meant that \"children are not learning as much as they can, not interacting as much as they can and are not having a normal life,\" he said, explaining that they are developing a plan with Ukraine's Ministry of Education to help facilitate regular connections for teachers or tutors with small groups of children to \"play, reflect or even do homework together.\"",
            "\"For small children, for first graders, live contact with an adult is critically necessary. Children have to learn a lot of things in contact not only with adults, but also with peers. It is very difficult to achieve this in a remote format,\" Horbachov said.",
            "The war has also caused a brain drain of teachers, with 22,000 of Ukraine's 434,000 educators (most of whom are women) having left the country, while many more remain internally displaced, he added.",
            "Those who have stayed are increasingly anxious. \"We conducted a survey among 350 teachers, and all of them indicated the prevailing emotion they feel is anxiety because of the increased responsibility to children,\" Teach for Ukraine's Matiiash said.",
            "The stress and trauma of war has also permeated among children, affecting their ability to study. Pavlenko said she is scared that the Russians \"will come here and the tanks will drive along our street, and they will knock on the door. That's what I'm afraid of.\"",
            "On Tuesday, the Ministry of Education issued a statement confirming that most Russian and Belarusian authors have been removed from its foreign literature programs as well as classes in the Russian language. Ukraine history and world history have also been amended, where \"the updated programs offer a view of the USSR as an imperial-type state.\"",
            "\"For two years now, according to the law, there should not be a single Russian-language school in Ukraine. As for the Russian language as a subject, parents who consider themselves ethnic Russians can file an application to study the language as a language of national minorities,\" Horbachov said. \"Besides, we have a big advantage over the Russians in that we understand their language, but they don't understand ours.\"",
            "'A lost generation'",
            "It comes as educators worry about the conditions for children living in Russian-occupied areas of southern Ukraine, like Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.",
            "Horbachov said they have received almost 500 messages from teachers living there who are being \"forced to work according to the educational programs of the occupiers,\" he said, adding that \"Ukrainian language and history have been thrown out of the (educational) programs.\" Pro-Ukrainian teachers have reported being evicted from their homes, and threatened with arrest and execution, he added.",
            "\"My appeal to the people who remained in the occupied territories ... to the teachers: we are grateful to them for the fact that they remain loyal to Ukraine and do not go voluntarily to cooperate with the occupiers, but (their) lives are more important,\" he said.",
            "The most important thing is to get children back into a routine, take their minds off the horrors of war, and see the value in education again, said Matiiash, citing another Teach for Ukraine study that found nearly half of children surveyed reported higher levels of stress. Children were also finding it \"hard to see the value in education if -- you know -- everything is falling apart around them,\" she added.",
            "\"This war is creating the risk of a lost generation,\" she added. Anecdotal evidence shows that people who have left the country \"cite education of children as one of the major reasons for why they are not returning to Ukraine,\" she said.",
            "\"That is why we need to prioritize giving schools proper bomb shelters, so that kids can continue to receive a proper education without constantly worrying about their safety.\"",

            "Like humans, dogs have tear ducts that well up with tears to keep their eyes clean and healthy. But tears in dogs, which tend not to fall as they do when humans cry, hadn't been linked with emotion before.",
            "Takefumi Kikusui, a professor at the Laboratory of Human-Animal Interaction and Reciprocity at Azabu University in Japan, decided to investigate dog tears after watching one of his two standard poodles when she had puppies six years ago. He noticed that her eyes got teary as she nursed her puppies.",

            "\"We also made the discovery of oxytocin as a possible mechanism underlying it,\" Kikusui said, referring to the hormone that in humans is sometimes called the love or maternal hormone.",
            "To investigate the link, Kikusui and his team measured the amount of tears among 18 dogs with a standard test known as the Schirmer Tear Test. It involved a paper strip placed inside the eyelids of the dogs for a minute before and after they were reunited with their owners following five to seven hours of separation.",
            "\"Tear volume was evaluated by the length of the wet part on the STT. The baseline was about 22 mm, and the reunion with the owner increased by 10%,\" Kikusui explained via email.",
            "With the help of 20 dogs, researchers then compared the amount of tears before and after reunions with their owners and people with whom the animals were familiar. Only the reunion with the owner increased the amount of tears.",
            "To understand whether oxytocin played a role in producing the tears, a solution containing the hormone was applied to the surface of 22 dog' eyes. The amount of tears significantly increased after the oxytocin was applied, compared with a control solution.",
            "There's still a lot the researchers don't know about dog tears. Humans often cry in response to negative emotions, but researchers didn't test to see if dogs did the same, too. They also don't know if a dog's ability to tear up plays a social function in the canine world.",
            "Kikusui said it was possible humans would better care for dogs that got teary-eyed. His team showed 74 people pictures of dogs' faces with and without artificial tears in them and asked them to rank the animals. People gave more positive responses when they saw dogs with teary eyes.",

There remains an open item the team will test on launch day, said Mike Sarafin, NASA's Artemis mission manager.",

            "When the spacecraft returns to Earth in October, it will face temperatures half as hot as the sun's surface and hit the top of Earth's atmosphere at 25,000 miles per hour (40,200 kilometers per hour) -- that's 32 times the speed of sound, Nelson said.",
            "\"Orion will come home faster and hotter than any spacecraft has before at 32 Mach,\" Nelson said. \"On the space shuttle, we were at 25 Mach, which is about 17,500 miles an hour (28,160 kilometers per hour).\" (Mach 1 is the speed of sound.)",
            "The heat shield has been tested on Earth, but returning from space is the one true test that simulations can't completely replicate.",
            "\"Re-entry will be great to demonstrate our heat shield capability, making sure that the spacecraft comes home safely, and of course for future missions, protecting the crew,\" Hu said.",
            "The ultimate test",
            "All of the objectives for the inaugural Artemis flight will demonstrate capabilities necessary for when Orion carries humans to deep space. The list includes an overall safe flight, the performance of the SLS rocket, testing the heat shield and retrieving the spacecraft once it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.",
            "Orion won't carry a crew on this initial mission, but it will be full of data from the flight -- including sensors attached to some very necessary passengers. Three mannequins will ride aboard Artemis I to simulate what humans might experience, and the data from their sensors will reveal how much vibration they experienced, as well as radiation exposure and the utility of their flight suits and radiation vests.",
            "Because Artemis I is a test flight, the Artemis team is willing to take more risks, said Mike Sarafin, NASA's Artemis I mission manager. Taking these risks now can eliminate issues when actual crew are aboard, he said.",
            "But more than all of the data and science the mission team will garner is the idea of resuming human space exploration by taking a big step forward from Apollo to Artemis.",
            "\"Artemis I shows that we can do big things things that unite people, things that benefit humanity -- things like Apollo that inspire the world,\" Nelson said. \"And to all of us that gaze up at the moon, dreaming of the day humankind returns to the lunar surface: Folks, we're here, we are going back and that journey, our journey, begins with Artemis I.\""

            "Zelensky said on Saturday that Russia might be planning \"particularly ugly\" attacks to coincide with the occasion, which will mark 31 years since Ukraine broke its ties with the Soviet Union and as the war nears its six-month milestone.",
            "\"We must all be aware that this week Russia could try to do something particularly ugly, something particularly vicious,\" Zelensky said in a video message.",
            "\"One of the key tasks of the enemy is to humiliate us, Ukrainians, to devalue our capabilities, our heroes, to spread despair, fear, to spread conflicts ... Therefore, it is important never, for a single moment, to give in to this enemy pressure, not to wind oneself up, not to show weakness,\" he said.",
            "In Kyiv, the city military administration issued a ban on all big gatherings between Monday and Thursday, saying \"it is forbidden to hold mass events, peaceful meetings, rallies and other events related to a large gathering of people.\"",
            "General Mykola Zhyrnov, head of Kyiv's military administration, said that the order was imposed so that security forces could respond in a \"timely manner to threats of missile and bomb attacks by the troops of the Russian Federation on decision-making centers, military facilities, defense industry facilities, critical infrastructure and nearby residential areas.\"",

        "Content": [
            "Until a year ago, crossing the Zambezi River between Botswana and Zambia was a slow and congested affair. For trucks moving along a key transport corridor, stretching from Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Durban, South Africa, the river was an obstacle without an elegant solution. Vehicles would load onto a pontoon, two at a time, when the current wasn't too strong and the rains not too heavy. It was a 10 to 15-minute journey that you could spend up to 15 days waiting for, recalls the head of one truck drivers' association.",
            "Today, the pontoons sit ashore, mercifully redundant. You might spot them while crossing the 923-meter (3,028-foot) long Kazungula Bridge, a $260 million project co-financed by Botswana, Zambia and the African Development Bank, that a year into service has already transformed this southern African trade artery.",
            "The bridge was conceived to speed up travel along the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) North-South Corridor, a route historically beset with costly border delays.",
            "Copper from DRC, Zambia and Tanzania traveling south before being shipped to China. Food from South Africa traveling north. Mining equipment from Tanzania heading to the DRC and Zambia. All pass across Kazungula, says Kaiko Salim Wamunyima, secretary general of the SADC Truck Drivers Association of Zambia.",
            "The bridge opened in May 2021 but was over a decade in the making, explains Kazungula project engineering manager Isaac Chifunda.",
            "Geopolitics played a large part in the bridge's design. Kazungula spans an area of Africa known as the \"quadripoint,\" says Chifunda. Sixty-five kilometers (40 miles) upstream from Victoria Falls, Botswana, Zambia, Namibia and Zimbabwe converge at the confluence of the Zambezi and Chobe rivers. The countries' borders extend into the rivers, so Kazungula Bridge was shaped with a pronounced curve to weave through the landscape, avoiding Zimbabwean waters, says Chifunda.",
            "\"Africa was massively represented on this project,\" says Chifunda. Although construction was overseen by South Korean company Daewoo E&C, the team was multinational, he says, and raw materials including cement, steel and aggregates came from across southern Africa.",
            "As a significant investment for Zambia and Botswana, the bridge is packed with technology to ensure its long-term future.",
            "Chifunda explains that a structural health monitoring system \"gives signals to which part of the bridge needs maintenance. And we also have a weather station -- we measure wind speed, rainfall, we even measure excitation, that is, the movement of the (suspension) cables.",
            "\"If there is danger, the station will send a signal through a message on the phone, through email as well, so that the two member states can attend to any maintenance needs.\"",
            "New customs",
            "At either end of the bridge are one-stop customs offices, so freight crossing the border only needs processing by one country. Expediency is necessary now that there is a higher volume of daily traffic.",
            "Chikumbi Chama, assistant commissioner at the Zambia Revenue Authority, says the bridge has allowed longer operating hours, with the border open between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. The old border facility received up to 80 trucks a day, now customs is receiving over 280, she adds, and \"the numbers are rising every day.\" But despite the higher volume of traffic, \"(the) transit period has been reduced to half a day.\"",
            "Truck driver Memory Lambie criss-crosses the region with a sign reading \"BOSS LADY\" in her windscreen. Nevertheless, she remembers the \"big challenge\" crossing the Zambezi before the bridge; 10-kilometer queues at the border and up to two weeks waiting to get into Zambia. \"Now it's easy,\" Lambie says, adding with the faster journeys, she's able to spend more time with her children.",
            "Keeping the wheels in motion",
            "A year after opening, the bridge is yet to realize its full potential, because the train line that runs through its center is not yet operational.",
            "The rail link is intended for both passengers and freight, says Chifunda, the project engineer, but crossings won't run simultaneously with cars and trucks. \"The bridge has been designed in such a way that the train and the vehicles cannot use the bridge at the same time,\" he explains. Vehicle traffic is cleared, then a train crosses, then vehicle traffic can resume.",
            "Once connected to existing rail infrastructure in Botswana and Zambia, an even higher volume of cargo will be able to travel across the bridge and around southern Africa, says Chama.",
            "This will likely bring down cargo transport costs. A 2015 African Development Bank report identified poor rail links in landlocked countries (like Botswana and Zambia) as limiting their economic potential. Diesel-powered rail freight can be up to 75% cheaper than road freight, yet roads still handle the overwhelming majority of cargo in the SADC.",
            "\"In the future landscape, I see rail cargo becoming a prominent feature,\" Chama adds. But a timeline for when the bridge will be fully connected is unclear, with talks between Botswana and Zambia ongoing, says Chifunda.",
            "In the meantime, trucks continue to pass back and forth across the Zambezi River, with greater haste and ease than ever before. For drivers like Lambie, it has already proved a revelation. \"The bridge is 100% perfect to us,\" she says.",
            "Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the African Development Bank's involvement in co-financing the Kazungula Bridge."

            "Hong Kong (CNN)As US President Joe Biden and top American officials traveled the world this summer, promoting a pledge of hundreds of billions of dollars for poorer countries, a largely unspoken motivation loomed in the background: competition with China.",
            "For nearly a decade, Beijing's sprawling overseas development initiative, known as the Belt and Road, has poured billions of dollars into infrastructure projects each year -- paving highways from Papua New Guinea to Kenya, constructing ports from Sri Lanka to West Africa, and providing power and telecoms infrastructure for people from Latin America to Southeast Asia.",
            "Washington now appears keen to bolster its own role in global infrastructure development as it intensifies its competition with China across the globe.",
            "In June, Biden and leaders from the Group of Seven advanced economies promised to unleash $600 billion in investment -- $200 billion of that from the US alone -- by 2027 to \"deliver game-changing projects to close the infrastructure gap\" between countries.",
            "This month, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman visited the South Pacific, promoting a new partnership to bolster support for island nations, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a plan aimed at Africa.",
            "\"We've seen the consequences when international infrastructure deals are corrupt and coercive, when they're poorly built or environmentally destructive, when they import or abuse workers, or burden countries with crushing debts,\" Blinken said during a visit to Pretoria, where he revealed the White House's new \"Sub-Saharan Africa Strategy.\"",
            "\"That's why it's so important for countries to have choices, to be able to weigh them transparently, with the input of local communities without pressure or coercion,\" he said in an apparent reference to common criticisms of Chinese-funded projects.",
            "The challenge from the United States comes at a precarious time for China's Belt and Road. Even as the initiative has had an impact on a number of countries, funding shortfalls and political pushback have stalled certain projects, and there is public concern in some countries over issues like excess debt and China's influence. Accusations that Belt and Road is a broad \"debt trap\" designed to take control of local infrastructure, while largely dismissed by economists, have sullied the initiative's reputation.",
            "Economic challenges at home and a changing financial environment globally also have the potential to impact how China's lenders and policymakers deploy funds, analysts say.",
            "All this may create an opportunity for Washington to step forward and work with willing partners in need of financing. But major questions hang over the extent to which the US can deliver, both in terms of mobilizing billions and driving infrastructure -- areas in which China has long excelled.",
            "Boom or bust?",
            "Since its official launch in 2013, early in the first term of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, funds under the initiative have powered the construction of bridges, ports, highways, energy and telecoms projects across Asia, Latin America, Africa and parts of Europe.",
            "To do this, China has relied on lending, with capital often coming not only from its development banks but state-run commercial lenders -- a stark difference to the American model that's been largely based on official aid.",
            "On average, during the first five years of the initiative from 2013 to 2017, China spent about $85 billion financing overseas development projects per year, more than twice as much as any other major economy, AidData, a research lab at William & Mary in the US, which tracks this spending from Chinese government institutions and state-owned entities, said in a 2021 report.",
            "And while funding has been welcomed by countries around the world, it has also come with problems.",
            "\"We find that 35% of (Belt and Road) projects are suffering from some sort of implementation challenge,\" said research scientist Ammar A. Malik, who heads AidData's Chinese Development Finance Program. He said those issues include environmental incidents, corruption scandals and labor violations, and the 35% figure refers specifically to projects implemented solely by a Chinese entity.",
            "AidData has also reported on what it terms \"hidden debts,\" referring to cases where the recipients of Chinese loans are entities like private or project companies, not governments themselves, but the terms of the loan require the host government to guarantee it. This can ultimately pass liability to them for repayment if the borrowers fall short, the researchers say.",
            "China has pushed back on assertions of risky lending or environmental issues in its projects, pointing to its \"green\" initiatives and saying \"such allegations do not reflect the whole picture.\"",
            "Another question concerns the direction of the initiative, especially as China's own economy flags amid a mortgage crisis and Covid-19 lockdowns, while many developing countries are struggling with rising debt and inflation -- making lending a potentially riskier proposition.",
            "Beijing has said it remains dedicated to the initiative, with its top diplomat Yang Jiechi at a trade forum on August 14 calling for Belt and Road to \"promote the early recovery and growth of the global economy.\"",
            "But while tracking investments across a wide range of players, and without a central, public Belt and Road data source, is difficult work, there are signs that China's efforts, especially big-ticket projects, have been slowing in recent years and since the pandemic.",
            "For example, Chinese loans to Africa dropped 77% from $8.2 billion to $1.9 billion from 2019 to 2020, according to data from the Boston University Global Development Policy Center.",
            "\"Potential reasons for this decrease include the Covid-19 pandemic's deterioration of economic conditions in host countries and a lack of host country demand due to fiscal constraints and debt issues. Limited travel and suspension of several (Belt and Road) projects may have also contributed to preventing financial deal closing,\" said data analyst Oyintarelado Moses of the center's Global China Initiative.",
            "\"Before the pandemic, Chinese policy bank finance was already on the decline. The pandemic appears to have accelerated this trend,\" she said, adding Chinese institutions would now \"take stock\" of their strategies.",
            "More time may be needed to observe whether Belt and Road infrastructure financing has peaked, and to assess the performance of the initiative overall, others say.",
            "\"The (initiative) is not even a decade old yet. Labeling it a failure because of delayed or distressed projects would be premature and simplistic, as would deeming it a success for Chinese global influence,\" said Austin Strange, an assistant professor of international relations at the University of Hong Kong.",
            "Build Back Better?",
            "The US is already the world's top donor of aid for developing countries. But whether it can mobilize its private sector and a recently revamped development finance arm, known as the US International Development Finance Corporation, to rival China as an infrastructure financier is another question.",
            "The G7 initiative, originally announced in 2021 under the name Build Back Better World, meanwhile, has gotten off to a slow start, analysts say. The leaders only formally launched the initiative -- now called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment -- in Germany this summer.",
            "In addition to the US pledge of $200 billion from grants, federal financing, and private sector investments, the White House promised the project would \"demonstrate how millions of dollars can mobilize tens or hundreds of millions in further investments and tens or hundreds of millions can mobilize billions.\"",
            "But unlike Beijing's model, where state-run entities play a key role, the US has no such ability to determine the size and scope of investments made by its private sector, analysts say.",
            "The US also doesn't have the same kind of domestic dynamics, such as excess capacity in the industrial sector, which made the Belt and Road an ideal outlet for the Chinese economy and enabled it to launch projects quickly.",
            "\"This is not the first time that expectation has been built, but it's going to be quite challenging to get private companies to finance (projects) because at the end of the day, they're accountable to their shareholders and they want projects that are bankable,\" said AidData's Malik.",
            "But while US private companies will be looking to return a profit, the plan does have the potential to open up opportunity for the US and partners in developing countries, particularly in certain sectors, analysts say.",
            "One reason is that US appears poised not to compete with China on the kinds of signature big-ticket items like bridges and railroads its known for, or to seek to push countries to choose it or China -- a choice few would likely be willing to make.",
            "Instead, it could use its own model of public-private finance and focus on areas where it may have competitive advantages, analysts say, with Biden laying out energy security and climate resilience, information and communications technology projects, as well as infrastructure that promotes gender equality and strengthens health care systems, as areas of focus.",
            "However, the US and its partners will need to do more than in the past to become \"strong alternative sources of investment\" chosen by partner governments over China, according to Moses at Boston University, who added US strengths in regulatory standards, transparency and environmental or social safeguards could appeal to some partners.",
            "The US may also need to face perceptions that it retreated from Africa after the end of the Cold War, only to return when there is another great power rivalry at play, according to Christopher Isike, director of the African Center for the Study of the United States at South Africa's University of Pretoria.",
            "\"When these initiatives come, like (the US' new \"Sub-Saharan Africa Strategy\") people are skeptical,\" he said.",
            "Governments on the continent, however, would welcome more sources of funding to meet shortfalls, and there is a perception that the US is more transparent and it has an advantage when it comes to soft power, according to Isike.",
            "As that great power competition returns to Africa, the question, he said, should not be whether or how countries would choose between the US or China, but if African governments \"would be ready to leverage the benefits of having this kind of contest.\""

            "\"That may well be why Zelensky said he wanted the war over before Christmas, because the real issues will be getting the West to stick to its promises in the long run.\"",

            "\"Within the European Union, it will be very difficult and we must try to stick to our promise to cut off Russia when it comes to any profits from gas and other sources,\" says a senior European diplomat, referring to a deal struck between the EU member states to cut their use of Russian gas by 15%.",
            "However, the agreement has been criticized for being voluntary, and officials fear that when push comes to shove, some EU countries simply won't play their part.",
            "\"There is the blob of Western Europe that is protected by distance and could not be convinced that becoming dependent on Russian energy was a catastrophic self-inflicted vulnerability, and even now hopes for a return to 'normality' with Russia,\" says Giles.",

            "\"Over time, the types of weapons we are sending have got more complicated, as has the training required to use them effectively. The good news is, these arms are helping the Ukrainians hold out.

French President Emmanuel Macron has repeatedly said that he believes at some point negotiations will need to take place between Russia and Ukraine, while Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz has come under fire for mixed messaging on Russian gas and most recently on whether or not Europe should ban Russians from obtaining travel visas.",
            "\"Do we all still have the same view of the end game? Is it just getting back to the borders of before Russia invaded? Or is it back to pre-2014, before Russia annexed Crimea?

It's better not to ask these questions right now.\"",
            "The next few months will be the hardest for European nations since the war began. Citizens will feel the cost-of-living crunch across the continent. Some will have to make choices between heating their homes and eating. This crunch comes as many European countries have already played host to thousands of Ukrainian refugees. Against this backdrop, it is hard for political leaders to justify spending money and energy supporting a country far away, especially when some of their citizens may feel that they've been generous enough as it is.",
            "Multiple Western officials told CNN of their concern that at some point, political leaders might decide the best thing is to broker for a peace deal and undercut the Ukrainian preferred end game, which is forcing Russian forces back to the previous borders.",
            "\"There is growing concern in some quarters that if Ukraine appears to be losing ground to Russia this may accelerate calls for a negotiated settlement. Zelensky must continue to work his PR magic and promote the message that Ukraine is still making progress, fighting hard and needs weapons,\" Theresa Fallon, director at the Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies, tells CNN.",
            "\"As soon as people sense that [Kyiv] is on the losing side they may start to ask why do we continue to supply costly weapons to Ukraine at a time of economic stress. Why are we throwing good money after bad,\" she says.",
            "This will be critical, she points out, as many key allies also go through turbulent political periods at home. Italy will hold an election, the United Kingdom will have a new prime minister and the United States will hold mid-term elections that may determine the rest of President Joe Biden's first term in office.",
            "\"As domestic political issues start to dominate, citizens might ask why are we helping Ukraine instead of building infrastructure,\" Fallon adds.",
            "For all that the West can reasonably pat itself on the back for its initial response to the crisis, things are about to get a hell of a lot harder. Most officials acknowledge that no one has a clue on how this conflict ends. And while most would like to see Ukraine achieve its goals of standing up to Putin and forcing him out of their country, their true resolve has yet to be fully tested.",
            "And the miserable truth is that should the time come, a negotiated peace involving Putin might not feel as much of a worry to countries that don't share a frontier with Russia and, bluntly, don't see Moscow as the sole cause of such an existential crisis."

            "Alexander Dugin, whose daughter Darya was killed Saturday by a car bomb, is the high priest of a virulent brand of Russian nationalism that has become increasingly influential in Moscow.",
            "At the age of 60, from a family of Russian military officers, his journey has been remarkable: from fringe ideologue to the leader of a prominent strand of thinking in Russia that sees it at the heart of a \"Eurasian\" empire defying Western decadence. He is the spiritual founder of the term \"the Russian world.\"",
            "Along the way, this strand has incorporated a deep loathing of Ukraine's identity outside of Russia.",
            "Dugin helped revive the expression \"Novorossiya\" or New Russia -- which included the territories of parts of Ukraine -- before the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin used the word in declaring Crimea part of Russia in March of that year.",
            "Dugin has long had a visceral loathing of Ukrainians resisting assimilation into \"mother Russia.\" After dozens of pro-Russian protesters were killed during clashes in Odesa in May 2014, he said: \"Ukraine has to be either vanished from Earth and rebuilt from scratch or people need to get it. I think people in Ukraine need total revolt on all levels and in all regions. An armed revolt against junta. Not only in the South-East.",
            "\"I think kill, kill and kill. No more talk anymore. It is my opinion as a professor,\" he said.",
            "The following year, Dugin was sanctioned by the United States as \"complicit in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, or sovereignty or territorial integrity of Ukraine.\"",
            "The birth of Eurasianism",
            "The work that propelled Dugin to prominence was the \"Foundations of Geopolitics\" in 1997, in which he set out his vision of a Eurasian empire, stretching from Dublin to Vladivostok. The book advocated sowing instability and dissent in the United States -- a pre-echo of the disinformation campaign around the 2016 US election.",
            "In one passage, he wrote: \"It is especially important to introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements -- extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S.\"",
            "The book, penned in the dying days of Boris Yelstin's chaotic presidency, became a best-seller in Russia.",
            "John Dunlop, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, wrote in 2004 that no other book had had \"an influence on Russian military, police, and statist foreign policy elites comparable\" to \"Foundations.\"",
            "The book prodded Dugin towards an academic career -- and for a while he was chairman of the international relations in the sociology department at Moscow State University.",
            "Dugin has always been one of Putin's most vocal supporters. In 2007 he said: \"Putin no longer has any opponents, and even if they did exist, they are mentally ill and should be sent for medical check-ups. Putin is everywhere, Putin is everything, Putin is absolute, Putin is irreplaceable.\"",
            "Gradually, inexorably, Dugin's views have moved from the fringe of political debate in Russia to its center.",
            "In 2011, when he was prime minister, Vladimir Putin began to talk of a Eurasian Union. Dugin reflected that Putin needed \"an ideology, a reason why he needs to come back\" for a third term as president.",
            "When Russia began supporting separatists in Donbas in 2014, Dugin was prominent in the Eurasian Youth Union, which recruited people with military experience to fight on behalf of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic.",
            "He also kept up a torrent of propaganda through the website Geopolitica, which the US asserts that he controls. The US Treasury said this year that it is \"a website that serves as a platform for Russian ultra-nationalists to spread disinformation and propaganda targeting Western and other audiences.\"",
            "Geopolitica, for example, contended this year that the US and NATO sought to provoke war with Russia, in order to \"further terrorize the American people in all sorts of malicious ways.\"",
            "Not short on enemies",
            "As one of the ideological architects of Russian expansionism, Dugin has referred to two \"versions\" of Putin, and wrote a book called \"Putin vs. Putin.\"",
            "He described the \"lunar\" Putin who is pragmatic and cautious, and the \"solar\" Putin, dedicated to the restoration of a Eurasian empire and confrontation with the West.",
            "In March, a month into the Ukrainian conflict, in an interview in a Moscow daily, Dugin declared that there was \"no doubt that the 'solar' Putin has won out, and that this was bound to happen, which I didn't say just a year ago, but for many years now.\"",
            "\"Russia has crossed the Rubicon, which I am personally very happy about,\" he said.",
            "To Dugin, that was essential because he says, the West was using Ukraine to try to bring down Russia. \"They believe that they have a chance to defeat Russia; not literally, because it is impossible, but to crush and force it to surrender, by excluding it from their global system.\"",
            "It was also essential, in his view, to show \"firm opposition to the Junta and Ukrainian Nazism that are annihilating peaceful civilians\" as well as rejection of liberalism and US hegemony -- language similar to that used by Putin in seeking to justify the invasion.",
            "Dugin is certainly not short of enemies within Russia. In a 2019 interview, he said: \"Everyone in power in Russia is scum. Except for Putin.\"",
            "Dugin said earlier this year that his adherence to the notion of \"Eurasianism\" is as strong now as it was when he wrote \"Foundations.\"",
            "\"Its center is the Russian people. And it is open to those peoples who combine their destiny with the fate of the Russian people.\"",

            "August and September are usually the busiest months for Li and other pomelo farmers in the Madou township, as they prepare for the harvest, but this year they're facing an unexpected challenge: Chinese import bans.",
            "On August 3, amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington over US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's controversial trip to Taiwan, Chinese Customs officials announced an import ban on all Taiwanese citrus fruits -- including pomelos -- as well as two types of fish, citing \"excessive pesticides\" and \"Covid-19 prevention\" measures. Taiwan has condemned the move as violating international trade norms.",
            "The announcement also came as Beijing conducted extensive drills encircling Taiwan in response to Pelosi's visit -- exercises that authorities in Taiwan said simulated a possible attack on the island. China's ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan is part of its territory, despite having never governed it, and has refused to rule out the use of force to bring it under control.",
            "Li, who typically sends about 60% of his pomelo harvest to mainland China, said he was \"very surprised\" when he first learned about the export ban, describing the situation as \"the most challenging\" since the family business began in the early 2000s.",
            "\"I didn't see the ban coming so far, we were caught off-guard,\" Li said. \"I can't do anything, it's some kind of political issue between Taiwan and China ... we simply want to grow good fruits and sell them at a good price.\"",
            "'Caught by surprise'",
            "During the annual pomelo harvest, Li is usually busy on the phone finalizing deals with buyers in China and other parts of Asia as his 40 contractors pick the best fruit to be packed into boxes and sent abroad.",
            "But this year, news of China's sudden import ban threw his plans into disarray.",
            "\"When I heard about the ban, I immediately called my business partner in China to check whether this is really the case,\" he said. \"I was caught by surprise, because we already signed contracts and set the price, and even the shipment dates were already confirmed.\"",
            "\"But now it's all in vain, so we have to try to find ways to sell them to the domestic market,\" he added.",
            "Li is not the only Taiwanese affected by China's economic retaliation. According to statistics from Taiwan's Council of Agriculture, Taiwan produced more than 82,000 tons of pomelo fruit last year, of which about 7% -- or about 5,000 tons -- were exported to mainland China.",
            "Together with China's import bans on other pomelo fruits and two fish products, the council estimated that Taiwanese exports worth 620 million Taiwanese dollars ($20 million) would be affected.",
            "Sun Tzu-min, general manager of Madou Farmers' Association, said there are about 2,000 to 3,000 pomelo farmers in the township, adding that while most pomelos are sold domestically, the ban would likely affect market price and reduce farmers' income.",
            "\"It's been hard for farmers,\" she said. \"A sudden ban can put everything on hold. The pomelo trees can live for decades, and their fruits get sweeter as the trees get older, so it's impossible for farmers to abandon them.\"",
            "\"When all the fruits stay on the island, the market price will go down for sure... farmers are losing money when their fruits can't be exported,\" she said.",
            "Fruits and politics",
            "Since last year, China has targeted a number of Taiwanese agricultural products as it steps up its military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan -- a self-governing, democratic island of 24 million people just off China's southeastern coast.",
            "Before the most recent ban, China had already suspended the imports of all Taiwanese pineapples, sugar apples, wax apples and grouper fish, each time citing the presence of pesticides or harmful chemicals.",
            "Experts have argued that Beijing's moves are a politically motivated attempt to pressure Taiwan to toe the line.",
            "\"The visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan has given China another chance to coerce Taiwan economically,\" said Chiao Chun, a former Taiwanese trade negotiator and author of \"Fruits and Politics\". \"This is a politically motivated economic sanction on Taiwan.\"",
            "\"Mainland China is attempting to influence the views of farmers and low-income Taiwanese towards the ruling party, because their products are banned from selling to China,\" he added.",
            "After the ban on pineapples last year, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu labeled the produce as \"freedom pineapples,\" while shoppers across Asia -- including the late former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe -- rushed to buy them as an act of political solidarity.",
            "Chiao said while the latest ban will have some short-term impact on Taiwanese farmers, it's unlikely to create any significant economic impact because agricultural exports only make up a tiny percentage of Taiwan's overall trade.",
            "The island's most valuable export is its cutting-edge semiconductor chips, which are needed to power everything from computers and smartphones to robots. One Taiwanese company in particular -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) -- is the world's largest contract manufacturer of chips, and accounts for 90% of the world's super-advanced chips, according to industry estimates.",
            "More than half of Taiwanese exports to China are semiconductors, while agricultural products make up less than 1% of the total value, according to Roy Lee, a deputy executive director at Taiwan's Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research.",
            "\"I think weaponizing sanctions on agricultural and food products produces a bigger symbolic effect than actual economic impact,\" Lee said.",
            "Chiao agreed that \"psychology is a bigger factor\" behind the import bans. However, he said that economic coercion will likely create greater anti-China sentiment among the Taiwanese public.",
            "\"This time, China announced these economic sanctions against the backdrop of large-scale military drills,\" he said. \"If you think of the military drills as the main protagonist, there must be other supporting roles. Hence the Commerce Ministry also enacted economic sanctions to support (China's) intimidation.\"",
            "China's economic sanctions against Taiwan",
            "Lee, the economist, said while China is Taiwan's largest trading partner, Beijing has so far not targeted more valuable Taiwanese industries because it could end up disrupting its own economy.",
            "\"Expanding economic sanctions to include semiconductors would have a bigger, negative impact on China's economic growth than (it would on) countries against which China is trying to achieve a political or diplomatic objective,\" he added.",
            "However, he cautioned that as cross-strait tensions worsened, Beijing could step up its retaliation by targeting Taiwanese firms operating in mainland China.",
            "Last year, Taiwanese conglomerate Far Eastern Group, which also operates in mainland China, was fined millions of US dollars by Chinese regulators over a series of violations. Chinese state media openly criticized the company for financially backing Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, prompting group chairman Douglas Hsu to declare that he opposes Taiwanese independence.",
            "\"I think we are going to see an increasing number of Taiwanese investments in China being investigated, or being pushed to make remarks or statements in favor of China's position toward Taiwan,\" Lee added.",
            "But for the farmers in Madou township, the impact of China's economic coercion has already been felt.",
            "To mitigate the financial impact, Taiwan's Council of Agriculture has announced plans to boost citrus fruit sales across the island with advertising and distribution campaigns, as well as providing subsidies for farmers.",
            "Sun, who heads the farmers' association, said they are also turning the pomelos into other products -- such as essence oil, jam and facial masks -- to attract new customers in Taiwan.",
            "But farmer Li is not optimistic. As pomelos begin to pile up in his depot, he worries that he may have to lay off 30% of his contractors next year if the ban is not lifted.",
            "\"To be honest, it doesn't matter who is visiting Taiwan,\" he said. \"The US-China tension should be solved between the two nations. I don't think Taiwanese farmers should be the ones to suffer.\""
