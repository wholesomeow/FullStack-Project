            "(CNN)President Joe Biden ordered airstrikes against Iranian-backed groups in Syria on Tuesday, a little over a week after a number of rockets struck near a military base in northeastern Syria housing US troops.",
            "The airstrikes conducted by the US military targeted Iranian-backed groups in Deir ez-Zor Syria, US Central Command said in a statement. The strikes targeted \"infrastructure facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,\" Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for CENTCOM, said in the statement.",
            "\"At President Biden's direction, US military forces conducted precision airstrikes in Deir ez-Zor Syria today. These precision strikes are intended to defend and protect US forces from attacks like the ones on August 15 against US personnel by Iran-backed groups,\" he said, referring to last week's attacks on the Green Village base near the Iraqi border. The incident did not result in damage or injuries.",
            "Biden, according to the statement, \"gave the direction for these strikes pursuant to his Article II authority to protect and defend US personnel by disrupting or deterring attacks by Iran-backed groups.\"",
            "Iran condemned the US airstrikes and denied any affiliation to the groups targeted in the location, in a statement quoting Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani. said.",
            "\"The US attack on Syrian infrastructure and people is a violation of Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" the statement said.",
            "A senior administration official told CNN that Biden asked for response options early last week, and the issue was discussed during a national security meeting in the Oval Office when the President was in Washington to sign the Inflation Reduction Act on August 16. On Monday, Biden was briefed on the options by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, and he ordered the strike after that briefing, the official said.",
            "Buccino said an initial assessment suggested no one was killed in the strikes but independent activist and human rights groups claimed up to ten people were killed.",
            "Activist group DeirEzzor24 said at least ten people were killed, and three others were wounded. They said the killed and wounded are \"foreigners\" and members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).",
            "Opposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least six Syrian and foreign militants were killed as a result of the airstrikes.",
            "Both organizations said the airstrikes targeted the Ayyash Camp run by the Fatimiyoun group made up of Shia fighters from Afghanistan.",
            "CNN cannot independently verify these claims.",
            "Sensitive moment",
            "The US airstrikes come at a critical time for US and Iranian relations, as there has been progress on reviving the Iran nuclear deal, aimed at preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. A senior administration official emphasized to CNN that there was no link between the strikes and efforts to revive the deal, saying the strikes were simply a response to recent Iranian attacks on US forces.",
            "\"Whether or not there is a deal, the President's commitment to protect US personnel and confront Iran's activities that jeopardize our people or our friends in the region is unwavering,' the official said. \"The nuclear deal has nothing to do with our readiness and ability to defend our people and our interests.\"",
            "Still, Tuesday's airstrikes appeared to send a clear signal that deal or not, the US will continue to respond to Iranian provocations.",
            "State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told CNN's New Day that reaching a renegotiated Iran deal would allow the US to \"address more effectively everything else that we face from Iran and its proxies and the groups that it supports in the region.\"",
            "\"There would be no greater challenge that the United States and our partners around the world face than an Iran with a nuclear weapon,\" Price said on Wednesday. \"The Iran deal is about one thing and one thing only, seeing to it that Iran is once again permanently and verifiably barred from every obtaining a nuclear weapon.\"",
            "Buccino told CNN the US targeted a group of bunkers used for ammunition storage and logistics support by Iranian-backed groups in Syria. The US military monitored a total of 13 bunkers in the same complex extensively, Buccino said, totaling more than 400 hours of surveillance.",
            "The strike was intended to target 11 of the bunkers, since the US could not be certain whether the other two bunkers were clear of people, Buccino said.",
            "But shortly before CENTCOM carried out the strike, the military waved off two more of the bunkers because of a small group of people nearby. In the end, Buccino said the military struck nine bunkers in the complex in eastern Syria.",
            "The goal of the strike was to destroy the bunkers, Buccino said.",
            "The Iranian-backed militia relocated weapons and munitions to new warehouses a kilometer away over fear of being targeted last week. Medium grade weapons, various types of missiles, launch pads and munitions were moved during night hours, according to DeirEzzor24.",
            "Though the airstrike on the bunkers was in response to the August 15 attack, Buccino said the bunkers were not used by Iranian-backed militias to carry out that particular attack.",
            "The base attacked earlier this month holds a \"small number\" of coalition forces, including US service members, one official previously said. Several of the rockets failed to launch and were recovered by forces from the US-led coalition and Syrian Democratic Forces. And earlier last week, multiple drones were repelled in an attack near the At-Tanf base in southern Syria.",
            "At the time of last week's strikes, the coalition did not say who was responsible for either of the attacks. However, Iranian-backed militias in the region have frequently targeted US troops in Syria and Iraq.",
            "In January, the US military conducted strikes in Syria after indirect fire posed what a US-led coalition official called \"an imminent threat\" to troops near Green Village.",
            "The US maintains approximately 900 troops in Syria, largely split between the At-Tanf base and the country's eastern oil fields.",

            "Barcelona (Reuters)Spanish prison authorities on Tuesday euthanized a man who shot and wounded four people in December and was subsequently wounded in a shootout with the police, rendering him paralyzed and begging to be allowed to die while awaiting trial.",
            "Courts allowed the man's assisted death after rejecting several appeals by his victims, who argued he should face justice. The case even reached the Constitutional Court, which refused to deliberate on it, saying there had been no violation of fundamental rights.",
            "Disgruntled former security guard Eugen Sabau, 46, shot three of his colleagues, including a woman, at the security services firm where he worked in the northeastern city of Tarragona, and then wounded a police officer while making his escape.",
            "Sabau died at 6.30 p.m. local time Tuesday, according to a source from the Catalan regional government.",
            "The prison authorities were unavailable for comment and Sabau's lawyer did not comment.",
            "Spain legalized euthanasia just over a year ago. Prior to this, helping someone to end their life carried a jail term of up to 10 years.",
            "After Sabau barricaded himself in a house with an arsenal of weapons, a tactical police unit stormed the place, shooting him several times.",
            "The \"Gunslinger of Tarragona,\" as the Spanish media referred to him, was left with tetraplegia and had one leg amputated. His wounds caused chronic pain that could not be treated with painkillers due to his fragile state, something he said made his existence unbearable.",
            "A court in Tarragona ruled that it was Sabau's fundamental right to request euthanasia considering these circumstances."

            "(CNN)The Kremlin's justification for invading Ukraine \"is a lie,\" a Russian paratrooper who previously publicly condemned his country's war in Ukraine has told CNN.",
            "Two weeks ago, Pavel Filatyev spoke out against the conflict in a 141-page-long testimony posted to his VKontakte social media page, then fled Russia. He is the first serving member of the Russian military to publicly criticize the invasion of Ukraine and leave the country.",
            "Now he tells CNN that his fellow troops as tired, hungry and disillusioned -- and that the Kremlin's war effort is \"destroying peaceful lives.\"",
            "\"We understood that we were dragged into a serious conflict where we are simply destroying towns and not actually liberating anyone,\" Filatyev told CNN's Matthew Chance. CNN is not disclosing the location of the interview for the security of the interviewee.",
            "\"Many understood that we do not see the reason that our government is trying to explain to us. That all of it is a lie,\" he said. \"We are just destroying peaceful lives. This fact immensely influenced our morale. That feeling that we are not doing anything good.\"",
            "Filatyev, 33, told CNN \"corruption\" and repression are rife in his home country and said his unit -- which was based in Crimea and sent to Ukraine entering Kherson early in the conflict -- was ill-equipped and given little explanation for Russia's invasion.",
            "According to Filatyev, the soldiers and their commanders did not know what they were expected to do in Ukraine. He added that they soon became disillusioned with the government's reasoning for its invasion after arriving in Kherson and facing resistance from locals who did not want to be \"liberated.\"",
            "The paratrooper served in Russia's 56th air assault regiment and was also involved in efforts to capture the city of Mykolaiv. He was evacuated from the front lines because of an injury.",
            "He told CNN the Russian army lacked basic equipment, as well as drones and other types of unmanned aircraft during his stint on the front line.",
            "\"Our barracks are about 100 years old and are not able to host all of our servicemen ... all of our weapons are from the times of Afghanistan,\" he said.",
            "\"Several days after we encircled Kherson many of us did not have any food, water or sleeping sacks on them,\" he said. \"Because it was very cold at night, we couldn't even sleep. We would find some rubbish, some rags, just to wrap ourselves to keep warm.\"",
            "The capture of Kherson was a significant early military success for Russia. Ukraine is now battling to regain the city as fighting increasingly shifts to the country's south.",
            "But Filatyev said he struggles to understand the vision of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion of Ukraine nearly six months ago and has seen his troops locked in a grinding, costly conflict.",
            "\"Now that I am out of there and without a gun, I think this is the worst, stupidest thing our government could have done,\" he said. \"I do not know where the government is leading us. What is the next step? Nuclear war?\"",
            "\"I see what is happening to my country and I am terrified. Everything is destroyed, corrupted,\" he told CNN. \"The only laws that function well are repressive ones.\"",
            "Filatyev fled Russia after conducting some initial media interviews. But he suggested the Kremlin could take revenge for his public position.",
            "\"I will either be put in prison ... or they will just silence me by taking me out. There were a lot of cases like that in the past,\" he said.",

            "(CNN)Six months have passed since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a war that by any conventional measure has been a calamity.",
            "Millions of Ukrainians have been displaced. The city of Mariupol has been nearly wiped from the map. And the offensive launched on February 24 has showcased moral rot within the Russian military and its complete disregard for civilian lives.",
            "By the Pentagon's latest reckoning, the invasion has cost Russia between 70,000 and 80,000 troops killed and wounded. Even if that estimate is on the high side, it's fair to extrapolate that Russia has probably seen more troops die in half a year's fighting in Ukraine than the Soviets lost over a decade of war in Afghanistan.",
            "But any comparisons of Putin's Russia to the waning days of the USSR are premature. Russia has indeed changed since February 24, but cracks in the edifice of Putinism are hard to discern. The majority of Russians have -- if not overtly -- supported the war, or have silently acquiesced to his campaign of imperial restoration.",
            "The Kremlin leader's ratings have been unaffected by the war. Both state pollster WCIOM and the independent polling agency Levada-Center routinely put Putin's approval ratings above 80% since February 24. A WCIOM survey in June found that 72% of Russians were likely to support Putin's \"special military operation,\" the official euphemism for the war in Ukraine.",
            "How is Putin maintaining his approval ratings?",
            "It's tempting to conclude that these numbers simply reflect the power of Russia's state propaganda and its dizzying ability to construct an alternate reality, in which Russian warships are not sunk by Ukrainian missiles and Russian bases blow up by accident.",
            "After all, the Russian government moved swiftly after the invasion to shut down the remnants of Russia's free press, introducing a draconian new law that imposed severe criminal penalties for \"fake\" information discrediting its armed forces.",
            "But that doesn't mean no information is getting out about Russia's disastrous losses in Ukraine. The Russian independent news site Mediazona -- which was labeled a \"foreign agent\" last year by Russian authorities -- has documented 5,185 military deaths, based on local news reports and social media posts.",
            "The country's relatively well-off middle classes have likely been insulated from the war's toll. Many of those killed in action are from poorer regions of Russia; the regions with the highest numbers of documented casualties are so-called \"ethnic republics\" of Dagestan and Buryatia, Mediazona found. By contrast, casualties from Russia's two wealthiest and most populous cities -- Moscow and St. Petersburg -- have been relatively low, it reported.",
            "Putin's popularity is sometimes chalked up to a climate of fear and conformity. According to OVD-Info, an independent group that tracks detentions in Russia, 16,380 people have been arrested or detained for anti-war activism in Russia, and 75 criminal cases have been opened under Russia's \"fake news\" law.",
            "Unsurprisingly, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has revived discussion among scholars about whether or not Putin's regime should be labeled as fascist. That may seem largely a question of taxonomy, but it points to a clear reality: After February 24, terms such as \"autocratic\" or \"authoritarian\" are inadequate to describe a state that tolerates no internal dissent.",
            "Will public opinion turn?",
            "That said, some observers wonder how long Putin can count on the support of broad segments of the Russian public amid harsh international sanctions that have isolated Russia from the global economy and drastically cut the supply of imports. Western investment has largely fled the country. Sectors of the economy such as aviation, which have long depended on aircraft manufactured in the US or Europe, have been hard hit.",
            "As CNN's Clare Sebastian recently noted, Putin and his technocrats have worked for years to sanction-proof the Russian economy, through import substitution -- developing homegrown replacements for imported goods -- and developing a payments system to avoid financial isolation.",
            "And Russia has spun the awkward rebranding of McDonalds and Starbucks into tales of economic resilience.",
            "But a recent study by the Chief Executive Leadership Institute of the Yale School of Management paints a more dire picture.",
            "The study's authors argue that Russia does not have the infrastructure to simply pivot energy exports such as natural gas to Asia; Russian manufacturers lack parts from international suppliers; and that Russia's official statistics are papering over the depth of Russia's economic retreat.",
            "\"Despite Putin's delusions of self-sufficiency and import substitution, Russian domestic production has come to a complete standstill with no capacity to replace lost businesses, products and talent,\" the report says. \"The hollowing out of Russia's domestic innovation and production base has led to soaring prices and consumer angst.\"",
            "Still, Russia's financial system has not collapsed, and consumer anxiety has not translated into political unrest. For Ukraine and its supporters, the conversation has now shifted to finding ways to inflict pain on Russians for their passive support of Putin.",
            "\"We are working on new sanctions against Russia and on stimulating the citizens of the terrorist state to feel their share of responsibility for what is happening,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a recent address. \"The discussion about visa restrictions in Europe for holders of Russian passports is expanding every day, new states and new politicians are joining it.\"",
            "It's unclear if a visa ban would ultimately change Russian behavior. Some European leaders -- most notably, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz -- have been reluctant to endorse a ban. Speaking at a recent press conference in Oslo, Scholz told reporters that leaders had to be \"very clear\" on the visa ban issue as the actions in Ukraine are \"Putin's war\" and \"not the war of the Russian people.\"",
            "And while Putin may be the decider, to borrow a George W. Bushism, there is also a collective Putin that supports him and helps realize his policies. Whatever economic consequences they face from sanctions, Putin's loyal oligarchs have not broken ranks.",
            "\"Putin's war with Ukraine has been going on for 6 months now,\" wrote imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny in what he called a \"rage thread\" from behind bars. \"From Day 1, Western leaders firmly stated that Putin's oligarchs and bribe-takers would face imminent sanctions and wouldn't get away this time. But they did.\"",
            "It's a dismal picture, and one that suggests that Putin -- who has survived snubbing by world leaders before -- is willing to play a long game here. He may perhaps be counting on the fact that, over the next six months, Europeans will be paying higher prices for energy, potentially raising the pressure on governments to push Ukraine to submit to a peace deal. Winter may be coming, but Ukrainians are also fighting for their national survival."

            "Iran's nuclear agreement with world powers came into effect that month, but the Trump administration withdrew from it just two years later, leading to a wave of tit-for-tat attacks that affected oil and shipping in the Persian Gulf.",
            "Those tensions culminated in a 2019 assault on Saudi oil facilities that knocked off half of the kingdom's crude production and threatened the very core of Gulf states' economies. It was part of a proxy conflict between the US and Iran, with the Arab states caught in the line of fire.",
            "As tensions grew, Gulf states found the US standing on the sidelines, either unwilling or unable to come to their rescue, with their own lines of communication with Iran all but severed.",
            "But much has changed since then. The United Arab Emirates is set to restore top level diplomatic relations, saying on Sunday that its ambassador, Saif Mohammed Al Zaabi, would return to Tehran \"in [the] coming days.\" Kuwait returned its ambassador last week and Saudi Arabia, whose lead the Gulf states followed in downgrading ties with Iran six years ago, is holding direct talks with the Islamic Republic.",
            "\"It's obvious there is a regional direction that is in tandem with Saudi movement,\" Mohammed Baharoon, director general of the Dubai Public Policy Research Centre, told CNN.",
            "The decision to return the ambassador \"comes within the UAE's regional orientation towards restoring bridges, strengthening relations, maximizing on what we share and building on it to create an atmosphere of trust, understanding and cooperation,\" tweeted Anwar Gargash, adviser to the UAE president.",
            "Dina Esfandiary, a Middle East adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, said Gulf Arab states have developed a \"pragmatic policy\" on Iran that involves both containment and engagement \"because they realized just one would not work on its own.\"",
            "She told CNN that, when the US didn't follow through on defending its Arab partners following the Aramco attacks \"it became imperative [for the UAE] to secure itself without relying on others -- the US in particular -- and engaging with Iran is a part of that.\"",
            "Ties between Abu Dhabi and Tehran have been progressively improving since then. The UAE is now the top exporter to Iran with bilateral trade rising to $21.4 billion in four months from March this year, from just $7 billion for all of 2019, according to Reuters.",
            "\"Financially and commercially, the UAE benefits the most from lessening regional tensions,\" Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political science professor in the UAE, told CNN. \"Even during the worst of political tensions between the two countries, trade was uninterrupted. It went down, but never stopped.\"",
            "The rapprochement comes amid uncertainty about the progress of indirect talks between the US and Iran to restore the nuclear agreement. If there is a new agreement, it may reduce the likelihood of a nuclear arms race in the already-tense region. But Gulf states fear that lifting the sanctions on Iran will unlock billions of dollars that can be used by Tehran to further arm itself and expand its influence in Arab countries through proxies.",
            "If the talks fail, observers say regional tensions could escalate as they did when then-US President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement, potentially dragging the region to war. For Gulf states, both scenarios are a cause for concern.",
            "\"For the Gulf Arabs, a return to the nuclear deal or no return is more or less the same: They anticipate that Iran will lash out in the region no matter the outcome,\" said Esfandiary. \"So, while they continue to watch this carefully, the efforts to improve their ties are more closely linked to their security and threat perceptions than the nuclear deal itself.\"",
            "Abdulla said Iran remains a serious threat to Gulf security \"with or without\" a nuclear agreement. \"So, one way to deal with Iran is to continue the conversation and find common ground for good neighborly relations.\"",

            "The resumption of diplomatic ties is \"not a silver bullet,\" Baharoon said. \"It is an important step, nonetheless.

The Iranians also dropped demands related to delisting several companies tied to the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the official said. Iran on Monday said the US had \"not yet responded to the proposals of the European side\" and accused the US of \"procrastinating\" in talks.",
            "Background: US President Joe Biden has insisted for months that he would not lift the IRGC terrorist designation in order to revive the nuclear deal. The policy is one of several foreign policy decisions made by Trump that Biden has maintained. Trump designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization in 2019 as part of a \"maximum pressure campaign\" imposed after he withdrew the US from the deal in 2018.",
            "Why it matters: In its response last week to a draft nuclear deal agreement proposed by the European Union -- which the EU has described as a \"final\" draft -- Iran did not demand that the IRGC be removed from the US list of terrorist organizations, the official said. \"The current version of the text, and what they are demanding, drops it,\" the official said. \"So if we are closer to a deal, that's why.\"",

Even today, the lake irrigates vineyards and local farms that grow everything from green vegetables to wheat and tangerines. Its archeology, hot springs and hiking trails bring tourism and livelihoods for local communities.",
            "But this place of religious pilgrimage \u2014 where the New Testament says many of Jesus' miracles were performed \u2014 is facing a bleak future. The climate crisis is causing huge fluctuations in the lake's water levels. Now it happens to be fairly full, but just five years ago, it hit a record low.",
            "Climate change and unsustainable water management are leaving lakes dried up all over the Middle East and beyond, but the Israeli government is hopeful it has a solution: It plans to pump water from the Mediterranean sea, take the salt out of it and send it across the country to top up the lake when needed.",
            "It's a dramatic change for the Sea of Galilee, called the Kinneret in Hebrew, which once pumped out nearly all of Israel's drinkable water. The water will now flow in the opposition direction.",
            "Israel has plenty of expertise in desalination. As a water-insecure nation, it has for more than two decades been taking seawater from the Mediterranean and treating it through a process called reverse osmosis, essentially taking the salt out of the water to make it drinkable. It's a process that other parts of the world, including California, have turned to in times of drought, but in Israel, it's an everyday reality. Five desalination plants along the coast now provide nearly all the tap water for the country's 9.2 million people.",
            "One problem is that these plants tend to run on natural gas, a fossil fuel that contributes to the climate crisis, which only worsens the extreme weather that is causing the lake's water levels to fluctuate in the first place. But in time, as grids transition to greener energy sources, Israel's solution may become more attractive.",
            "The new project looks a little underwhelming \u2014 a 1.6-meter-wide water pipe laid across 31 kilometers \u2014 but it's the first of its kind. It will take the desalinated water and pump it through the Tsalmon stream that feeds the lake.",
            "When he first heard of the project, Noam Ben Shoa, head engineer at Israel's national water company, Mekorot, thought it was a strange idea.",
            "\"But very soon, we understood the value it has to the national market itself,\" he told CNN at a construction site for the pipe.",
            "It also helps with the development of agriculture in the wider region, he said, as well as relations with neighboring Jordan.",
            "Israel has a long standing agreement with Jordan to sell tens of millions of cubic meters of water annually to the kingdom. In 2021, the two countries signed a new agreement where Jordan would receive 200 million cubic meters of desalinated water a year from Israel \u2014 about 20% of Jordan's water needs \u2014 in return for solar energy to help power Israel's electric grid. Emirati companies would build 600 solar power plants in Jordan to generate the energy.",
            "Within months, the new $264 million pipeline is expected to be functional, and will be able to move 120 million square meters of water per year, but will only pump to the lake when necessary, Ben Shoa said.",
            "\"The uniqueness of this project is that it gives us almost infinite flexibility,\" he said. \"We can basically take the water where it is available ... and just divert it and transport it to wherever it is needed. In the population centers, for agricultural or industrial uses as well.\"",
            "Getting ahead of the crisis",
            "The need to do things radically differently hit home during the most recent, five-year drought, which ended in 2018. Despite a ban on pumping water from the lake, water levels here still reached a record low. But it's also what's to come with the worsening climate crisis that has pushed Israel's water authority to intervene now.",
            "\"They looked into the future climate change, and what's going to happen [with] rainfall in this area, and also looked at the increase in population and projected increase in demand of water,\" Gideon Gal, senior scientist and head of the Kinneret Limnological Laboratory, told CNN. \"And they realized that 30, 40 years from now, there's going to be a serious problem in maintaining [water] levels in the lake, and maintaining water quality unless something is done.\"",
            "But that something had never been done before. Even if salt is removed, the makeup of the water is also different in other ways, Gal said.",
            "\"When you mix desalinated water with natural water, you see an impact on the biology in the experiments,\" Gal said. \"We'll be bringing things to the lake that may not exist naturally.\"",
            "But so far, Gal says their experiments show the new water won't cause a huge impact on existing species.

            "The northern hemisphere did indeed witness record temperatures, with wildfires engulfing parts of Europe and drought threatening food supplies. And, often, European cities witnessed hotter conditions than those in the Persian Gulf.",
            "But experts say that temperature alone isn't an adequate measure of the livability of a city -- a combination of heat and humidity is. And that's why the Middle East is far less livable than Europe even at the same temperatures.",
            "The Middle East is still quite hot. The Iranian city of Abadan set the record for the hottest dry heat temperature this year when it hit 53 degrees Celsius (127 degrees Fahrenheit) on August 5. But combine that with the high levels of humidity in the region and it becomes an even more inhospitable place for human beings. It's harder to cool down when the weather is humid, as our bodies struggle to transfer their heat to \"wet\" air rather than dry air, making it harder to sweat it out and lower our body temperatures.",
            "The measure of heat combined with humidity is called the wet bulb temperature. The name stems from the way this condition is measured, literally by wrapping a wet cloth around a thermometer and measuring the temperature as the water evaporates.",
            "This speaks directly to our body's ability to cool itself through sweating.",
            "\"The wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that can be reached by evaporative cooling,\" Tapio Schneider, a professor of environmental science and engineering at the California Institute of Technology, told CNN.",

On the same day, average temperatures in both London and Dubai were 34C -- but the wet bulb temperature in London was 20C, while Dubai was a more painful 27C.",
            "The Persian Gulf is one of the few places in the world ever to record a wet bulb temperature that exceeds the threshold of human survivability, 35C. Since 2005, there have been nine separate occasions of this on record.",
            "A wet bulb temperature of 35C means the body can no longer cool itself to a temperature that can maintain normal functions.",

            "Wet bulb temperatures just under 35C aren't ideal either. \"Humans experience heat stress at lower wet bulb temperatures too,\" he said. \"And the degree to which they can survive such heat stress does depend on fitness, age, and pre-existing conditions.\"",

            "Background: Al-Shehab, a PhD student at Leeds University in the United Kingdom, was arrested in January 2021 and subjected to questioning sessions over a period of 265 days before being brought to the Specialized Criminal Court, ALQST said in a statement. The mother of two was initially given a six-year sentence late last year which was increased to 34 years after al-Shehab filed an appeal, according to court documents. The charges filed against her by the Public Prosecution included \"providing succor to those seeking to disrupt public order and undermine the safety of the general public and stability of the state, and publishing false and tendentious rumors on Twitter,\" ALQST added.",

Lina Al-Hathloul, the organization's head of Monitoring and Communications, told CNN that al-Shehab had been arrested for supporting her sister Loujain al-Hathloul, a prominent activist who spent more than 1,000 days in jail.

            "Background: The five groups had been labeled as terrorist organizations by the Israeli government last year, which accused them of acting \"undercover on the international front on behalf of the 'Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),' to support its activity and further its goals.\" The Palestine Liberation Organization condemned the move, saying it will appeal to human rights organizations \"to intervene immediately and condemn the closure of non-governmental organizations and pressure to reopen them.\"\nWhy it matters: The move drew dismay and protests from international organizations. B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights watchdog, condemned the raids and described Israel's accusations as false. \"We will continue to work with our colleagues in the Palestinian NGOs to dismantle the apartheid regime,\" a statement from the organization said. Although not directly connected, the news also comes after the worst bout of violence between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants since a brief war last May. Earlier in August, more than 40 Palestinian militants and civilians, including 15 children, were killed during two and a half days of fighting, after Israel launched strikes on targets of the Islamic Jihad militant group in Gaza.

Urging Russia and Ukraine to find \"the shortest and the fairest way to the negotiating table,\" the Turkish leader said on Thursday: \"I maintain my belief that the war will eventually end at the negotiating table.

            "Why it matters: Turkey has been hosting talks between delegates from Russia and Ukraine for months now, and Erdogan has been vying for a mediation role in the conflict. That role was seemingly elevated after Ankara helped broker the deal to allow exports of grain from the blockaded Ukrainian ports. In the process, Erdogan has been engaged in a strategic balancing act between Russia on one side, and Ukraine and the West on the other.

It is one of the largest narcotics producers in the world -- last year, the US government estimated was producing over one million kilograms of cocaine, the highest in the world and more than the two closest nations, Peru and Bolivia, combined. So when the South American country's new president says he intends to regulate the use of illegal substances -- or at least some of them -- the world listens.",
            "\"It is time to accept that the war on drugs has been a complete failure,\" Colombian President Gustavo Petro announced during his inauguration festivities earlier this month, commenting on a bill his administration recently presented to legalize recreational marijuana to Congress.",
            "Colombia's law already allows the production of cannabis for medical purposes, mostly to be exported to foreign markets like the United States and Canada, but supporters of the new legislation believe that only legalizing recreational cannabis can push thousands of farmers away from drug trafficking and into the legal trade.",
            "To this day, the Colombian state faces challenges over control of its territory by a variety of criminal actors, from former left-wing guerrillas and paramilitaries to narco-cartels and organized crime syndicates. Drug trafficking is a powerful source of revenue for these outlaws, and over the past 50 years public authorities have pushed a prohibitionist agenda, banning the trade and consumption of drugs in order to hit the criminals in their pockets. But the stream of illegal drugs never ceased.",
            "\"We will never achieve peace in Colombia until we regulate drug trafficking,\" said Senator Gustavo Bolivar, one of the signatories of the new bill and a close ally of the new president.",
            "\"Not even the United States, with all their might and money, could win the war on drugs... Right now, Colombia produces more drugs than when Pablo Escobar was alive, there are more consumers, more farmers. The drug trade is growing despite the money we invest in fighting it, and the thousands of deaths we suffer,\" said Bolivar, who recently traveled to Colorado for a firsthand look at the economic benefits of legalizing weed.",
            "In an interview, Bolivar told CNN it was hypocritical of the United States to legalize marijuana at home, and supporting drug wars abroad such as in Colombia, where Washington sends millions of dollars every year to arm and train Colombian forces in their struggle against the cartels.",
            "A landmark report from the Truth Commission, an interdisciplinary panel tasked to investigate over 50 years of civil conflict in Colombia, found that drug trafficking helped prolong the conflict despite almost $8 billion in military aid from the US to Colombia. At least 260,000 Colombians, the vast majority civilians, were killed in the violence.",
            "A new generation of Colombian leaders",
            "The campaign to legalize weed in Colombia unites left-wing senators like Bolivar with civil society organizations and deep-pocketed foreign investors, and has received a boost over the last 12 months from the country's changing politics, with Petro ascending to the presidency and progressive parties now a majority in Colombian congress.",
            "\"We saw the legalization of adult-use recreational two, three, or four years down the line... but now we're hoping for this year,\" said Luis Merchan, a Colombian businessman who is the CEO of Flora Growth, a Toronto-based company that is investing in Colombian marijuana from medical cannabis to textile hemp.",
            "The campaigners who have demanded this shift for years agree.",
            "\"We think now the time is ripe to do it,\" says Luis Felipe Ruiz, an investigator at Colombia's NGO Dejusticia, which supports decriminalizing drugs and has documented the war on drugs for years. Drug trafficking is the top cause of detention in Colombia and, according to the Colombian Justice Ministry, 13% of the country's detainees are serving a sentence related to the drug trade. Ruiz argues that one of the benefits of legalizing marijuana would also be decreasing the prison population in the country.",
            "\"There's a large part of the political world that is ready to have a debate on legalizing marijuana and, frankly, taking away the stigma against cannabis is already a great victory for us,\" Ruiz told CNN.",
            "Those who oppose legalization hail from the conservative right and believe the shift would just make drug abuse easier. Former President Alvaro Uribe, a political mentor of Petro's predecessor Ivan Duque and the main exponent of conservativism in the country, tweeted in 2020 that \"recreational marijuana leads to other drugs, alters the neurons, the consumer reaches states of alienation, loses control over his decisions, which is the loss of his freedom,\" celebrating when a previous project to legalize weed was blocked in Congress.",
            "Illegal agriculture",
            "Historically, marijuana in Colombia is grown by small-scale farmers who cannot afford the pharmaceutical licenses required to produce medical cannabis, so they sell their product to drug cartels.",
            "The bill presented to Congress could allow these small-scale farmers, most of them based in chronically underdeveloped rural regions of Colombia, to finally enter the legal market.",
            "COCCAM, a confederation of coca, marijuana and poppy growers that works as a lobbying group for illicit farmers, estimates that up to 3,000 families depend on illegal marijuana as a main source of their income, mostly in the southwestern department of Cauca. In most cases, these farmers live in isolated rural areas that are hours away from the closest paved road.",
            "Compared to legal agricultural products like fruit and vegetables, marijuana and coca leaves don't spoil for days and sell at a higher price per kilogram. They also have the advantage of growing all-year round, while most plants give a harvest only a few months a year.",
            "Because of Colombia's historic role, legalizing recreational use would be an immense cultural shift -- and perhaps a source of pride, Marchan said.",
            "\"It would be not only a source of pride for someone like me for what was frowned upon: I have been in business for a number of decades and when somebody learns that I'm from Colombia you always get the 'ahh,' that weird look,\" he said.",
            "Legal cocaine?",
            "Bolivar, the senator, believes the Colombian regulatory system will, eventually, follow the same path by legalizing not only marijuana but even cocaine -- the most lucrative source of income for the cartels.",
            "Drafting numbers on an illegal market is never an exact science, but a 2016 study from the Colombian government estimated that drug trafficking -- the flow of illegal drugs, mostly cocaine, that is produced in Colombia and sold in international markets from Europe, to North America, to Asia -- was worth up to 3.8% of the Colombian GDP or $7.5 million at the time.",
            "In comparison, illegal drug consumption -- intended as the drugs that are consumed illegally in Colombia and where marijuana plays a larger role -- was worth 0.75% of the Colombian GDP -- $2.18 million.",
            "\"Marijuana is small change in the drug business. The big money that the cartels are making, and the lion's share of the problem, is called cocaine. And people in Colombia and Mexico will continue to die as long as we look at the problem with hypocrisy,\" Bolivar told CNN.",
            "He envisions a network of state-regulated dispensaries where cocaine could be sold under medical prescription, and regional agreements across other drug producing countries. The three largest producers of cocaine in the world -- Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru -- are all currently ruled by ideologically aligned, left-wing leaders. Bolivia has a thriving legal market of coca byproducts, mostly dry leaves that are chewed by the indigenous population and already in 2012, the governments of Bolivia and Colombia pushed for a regional re-thinking of drug policies in multilateral meetings.",
            "\"We could for example make a small treaty in our countries to modify the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs and plant the first flag of legalization in the world; other countries may follow,\" the senator said.",
            "But before international treaties are rewritten, Colombia might still have a legal battle ahead of it. As it stands, the Colombian constitution explicitly forbids using narcotic drugs without medical prescription; so even if Congress passed a law legalizing recreational marijuana, it could be deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.",
            "An appeal to eliminate that article has already started by another lawmaker, Congressman Juan Carlos Losada.",
            "\"It's a two-front battle. Our legalizing bill in Congress, and the appeal by Losada to the constitutional court. Whichever comes first we will support it, because this country needs peace,\" said Bolivar."

            "\"It wasn't that easy,\" Amisial said. \"In Haiti it's hard to do government stuff. When I started the process it seemed fine but then they asked me for a lot of money but I didn't have the funds.\"",

            "The North Carolina resident set out to refute a widely circulated video of a Tesla with the company's \"full self-driving\" beta software -- which allows the car to steer, brake and accelerate, but requires an attentive human driver ready to take the wheel -- plowing into child-size mannequins.",
            "Dan O'Dowd, a software company CEO who published the video earlier this month, thinks the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should ban \"full self-driving\" until Tesla CEO Elon Musk \"proves it won't mow down children.\"",
            "That's when Cupani, who runs an auto shop focused on imports and Teslas, got involved and recruited his son. While he's a self-described \"BMW guy,\" Cupani says the software can't compare to what Tesla offers. It also wasn't the first time he'd enlisted his son, who Cupani said is 11 years old, in a potentially viral car endeavor: Earlier this year he posted a video of his son driving his Model S Plaid \u2014 which can reach 0-60 in 1.99 seconds \u2014 in a private parking lot. It's been viewed more than 250,000 times.",

            "Cupani filmed the test of \"full self-driving\" in a parking lot. His son stood near the end of an aisle holding a smartphone to film the test. Cupani accelerated the Tesla from the other side of the lot and turned on \"full self-driving,\" reaching 35 mph. The Tesla braked steadily and came to a full stop -- well ahead of his son.",
            "Cupani did another test with his son on a street using Autopilot, the more rudimentary Tesla driver-assist software, and found it stopped for his son, too. \"This Dan guy, he says he's an expert in this, expert in that,\" Cupani said. \"Well, I'm an expert in automotive, future technology, pro driving instructor.\"",
            "Cupani is among the many Tesla supporters who took issue with O'Dowd's video, and set out to create their own tests. Some asked their children to help. Others built homemade mannequins or used blow-up dolls.",
            "The passionate defenses and criticism of \"full self-driving\" highlight how the technology has become a flashpoint in the industry. The California DMV recently said the name \"full self-driving\" is deceptive and grounds for suspending or revoking Tesla's license to sell vehicles in the state. Ralph Nader, whose 1960s criticism of the auto industry helped spark the creation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), joined a chorus of critics of \"full self-driving\" this month.",
            "But it also is yet another example of the unintended consequence of deploying an unfinished, disruptive technology in the wild -- and shows how far some Tesla believers are willing to go to defend it and the company.

            "Park's tests, unlike O'Dowd's, started with the Tesla at 0 mph. The Tesla stopped in all of Park's tests ahead of two of his children involved in the video, including a 5-year-old. Park said he wasn't comfortable doing a higher speed test of 40 mph -- like O'Dowd performed using the mannequins -- with his kids.",

            "His Tesla slowed as it approached \"box boy.\" Then it sped up again and struck his cardboard mannequin. Cadamuro speculated that this could be because the cameras could not see the short boxes once they were immediately in front of the bumper, and therefore forget they were there.",
            "Human babies learn at about eight months that an object out of sight still exists, many years before qualifying for a driver's license. But the ability may still elude some artificial intelligence systems like Tesla's \"full self-driving.\" Another Tesla fan found a similar result.",

            "Some Tesla supporters had criticized O'Dowd's use of cones as lane markings in his original testing, which may have limited the sedan's ability to steer around the mannequin. Others claimed that O'Dowd's test driver had forced the Tesla to strike the mannequin by pushing the accelerator, which wasn't visible in videos O'Dowd released. Some Tesla enthusiasts also pointed to a blurry messages on the screen of the Tesla vehicle as an indication that O'Dowd's test driver was pushing the accelerator to rig the tests.",
            "O'Dowd told CNN Business that the blurry messages referred to supercharging being unavailable, and to uneven tire wear. CNN Business could not independently verify what the message said as O'Dowd provided no crisper video of what happened in car during the tests.",
            "In his second video, O'Dowd's tested without cones on a residential street and showed the interior of the Tesla, including the accelerator pedal. The Tesla, as in O'Dowd's other tests, struck the child mannequin.",

            "The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That's roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.",
            "\"Every rooftop in America that isn't producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,\" Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America's campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. \"Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there's no better place than the roofs of America's big-box superstores.\"",
            "Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.",
            "Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report's authors told CNN.",
            "CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers \u2014 Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target \u2014 to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?",
            "Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks \u2014 regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves \u2014 that are preventing more widespread adoption.",
            "The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming \"unquestionably urgent\" as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.",
            "\"We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,\" Cowen told CNN. \"I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There's still a tremendous amount of work to do.\"",
            "What's the holdup?",
            "Neumann said Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space \u2014 an area larger than Manhattan \u2014 and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.",
            "It's enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.",
            "Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.",
            "Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it's aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.",
            "\"Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,\" Neumann told CNN. \"And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.\"",
            "According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company's installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location's electricity needs.",
            "Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association's most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar \u2014 around a quarter of the company's stores \u2014 a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties' energy needs, the spokesperson said.",
            "Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.",
            "Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.",
            "\"My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,\" Neumann said. \"Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.\"",
            "Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D'Arcy, the company's director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores' energy needs on average, he said.",
            "Aging rooftops at stores are a \"huge impediment\" to solar installation, D'Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn't make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.",
            "\"We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,\" D'Arcy told CNN.",
            "CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties \u2014 stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants \u2014 with solar installations. One of the \"multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation\" was the stores' ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.",
            "Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.",
            "\"For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,\" Cowen said. \"It's just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.\"",
            "Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has \"failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.\" The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because \"our system is so disjointed\" and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.",
            "\"Why aren't we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,\" Casten told CNN. \"For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn't want to lose the load.",
            "\"We could have done this decades ago,\" Casten added. \"And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we'd also have a lot more money in our pocket.\"",
            "Acting on climate, equitably",
            "For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.",
            "Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels \u2014 and it's doable, Callaway told CNN.",
            "The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.",
            "In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.",
            "\"One of my huge concerns is social equity,\" Cowen said. \"Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we've got to figure out ways to make that not true.\"",
            "Jasmine Graham, WE ACT's energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only \"if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.\"",
            "Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.",
            "Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.",
            "\"The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we'll have cleaner air, the sooner we'll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we'll have a more livable future for our kids,\" Neumann said. \"And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.\"",

            "Around 4:30 p.m., Orion will make its first outbound trajectory correction burn using the European Service Module, which provides the spacecraft with power, propulsion and thermal control. This maneuver will put Orion on a path to the moon.",
            "The next few days after launch, Orion will venture out to the moon, coming within 60 miles (96 kilometers) during its closest approach of the lunar surface on day six of the journey -- or September 3 if the launch occurs as planned on August 29. The service module will place Orion in a distant retrograde orbit around the moon on day 10, or September 7.",
            "Orion will surpass the distance record of 248,654 miles (400,169 kilometers) -- set by Apollo 13 in 1970 -- on September 8 when it loops around the moon. The spacecraft will achieve its maximum distance from Earth of 280,000 miles (450,616 kilometers) on September 23 when it ventures 40,000 miles (64,373 kilometers) beyond the moon.",
            "This is 30,000 miles (48,280 kilometers) farther than Apollo 13's record.",
            "Orion will make its second-closest approach of the lunar surface, coming within 500 miles (804 kilometers), on October 3. The service module will experience a burn that enables the moon's gravity to slingshot Orion back on its way to Earth.",
            "Just before reentering Earth's atmosphere, the service module will separate from Orion. The spacecraft will hit the top of Earth's atmosphere moving at about 25,000 miles per hour (40,233 kilometers per hour), and its heat shield will experience temperatures of nearly 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius).",
            "The atmosphere will slow Orion down to about 300 miles per hour (482 kilometers per hour), and a series of parachutes will slow it down to less than 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) before it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean at 11:53 a.m.",
            "Splashdown will stream live from NASA's website, collecting views from the 17 cameras aboard the recovery ship and helicopters that will be waiting for Orion's return.",
            "The landing and recovery team will collect the Orion capsule, and the data collected by the spacecraft will determine what lessons have been learned before humans return to the moon."

            "(CNN)The Kremlin's justification for invading Ukraine \"is a lie,\" a Russian paratrooper who previously publicly condemned his country's war in Ukraine has told CNN.",
            "Two weeks ago, Pavel Filatyev spoke out against the conflict in a 141-page-long testimony posted to his VKontakte social media page, then fled Russia. He is the first serving member of the Russian military to publicly criticize the invasion of Ukraine and leave the country.",
            "Now he tells CNN that his fellow troops as tired, hungry and disillusioned -- and that the Kremlin's war effort is \"destroying peaceful lives.\"",
            "\"We understood that we were dragged into a serious conflict where we are simply destroying towns and not actually liberating anyone,\" Filatyev told CNN's Matthew Chance. CNN is not disclosing the location of the interview for the security of the interviewee.",
            "\"Many understood that we do not see the reason that our government is trying to explain to us. That all of it is a lie,\" he said. \"We are just destroying peaceful lives. This fact immensely influenced our morale. That feeling that we are not doing anything good.\"",
            "Filatyev, 33, told CNN \"corruption\" and repression are rife in his home country and said his unit -- which was based in Crimea and sent to Ukraine entering Kherson early in the conflict -- was ill-equipped and given little explanation for Russia's invasion.",
            "According to Filatyev, the soldiers and their commanders did not know what they were expected to do in Ukraine. He added that they soon became disillusioned with the government's reasoning for its invasion after arriving in Kherson and facing resistance from locals who did not want to be \"liberated.\"",
            "The paratrooper served in Russia's 56th air assault regiment and was also involved in efforts to capture the city of Mykolaiv. He was evacuated from the front lines because of an injury.",
            "He told CNN the Russian army lacked basic equipment, as well as drones and other types of unmanned aircraft during his stint on the front line.",
            "\"Our barracks are about 100 years old and are not able to host all of our servicemen ... all of our weapons are from the times of Afghanistan,\" he said.",
            "\"Several days after we encircled Kherson many of us did not have any food, water or sleeping sacks on them,\" he said. \"Because it was very cold at night, we couldn't even sleep. We would find some rubbish, some rags, just to wrap ourselves to keep warm.\"",
            "The capture of Kherson was a significant early military success for Russia. Ukraine is now battling to regain the city as fighting increasingly shifts to the country's south.",
            "But Filatyev said he struggles to understand the vision of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion of Ukraine nearly six months ago and has seen his troops locked in a grinding, costly conflict.",
            "\"Now that I am out of there and without a gun, I think this is the worst, stupidest thing our government could have done,\" he said. \"I do not know where the government is leading us. What is the next step? Nuclear war?\"",
            "\"I see what is happening to my country and I am terrified. Everything is destroyed, corrupted,\" he told CNN. \"The only laws that function well are repressive ones.\"",
            "Filatyev fled Russia after conducting some initial media interviews. But he suggested the Kremlin could take revenge for his public position.",
            "\"I will either be put in prison ... or they will just silence me by taking me out. There were a lot of cases like that in the past,\" he said.",
            "\"I do not see any other way out. If it happens, it happens.\""

        "Content": [
            "(CNN)Six months have passed since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a war that by any conventional measure has been a calamity.",
            "Millions of Ukrainians have been displaced. The city of Mariupol has been nearly wiped from the map. And the offensive launched on February 24 has showcased moral rot within the Russian military and its complete disregard for civilian lives.",
            "By the Pentagon's latest reckoning, the invasion has cost Russia between 70,000 and 80,000 troops killed and wounded. Even if that estimate is on the high side, it's fair to extrapolate that Russia has probably seen more troops die in half a year's fighting in Ukraine than the Soviets lost over a decade of war in Afghanistan.",
            "But any comparisons of Putin's Russia to the waning days of the USSR are premature. Russia has indeed changed since February 24, but cracks in the edifice of Putinism are hard to discern. The majority of Russians have -- if not overtly -- supported the war, or have silently acquiesced to his campaign of imperial restoration.",
            "The Kremlin leader's ratings have been unaffected by the war. Both state pollster WCIOM and the independent polling agency Levada-Center routinely put Putin's approval ratings above 80% since February 24. A WCIOM survey in June found that 72% of Russians were likely to support Putin's \"special military operation,\" the official euphemism for the war in Ukraine.",
            "How is Putin maintaining his approval ratings?",
            "It's tempting to conclude that these numbers simply reflect the power of Russia's state propaganda and its dizzying ability to construct an alternate reality, in which Russian warships are not sunk by Ukrainian missiles and Russian bases blow up by accident.",
            "After all, the Russian government moved swiftly after the invasion to shut down the remnants of Russia's free press, introducing a draconian new law that imposed severe criminal penalties for \"fake\" information discrediting its armed forces.",
            "But that doesn't mean no information is getting out about Russia's disastrous losses in Ukraine. The Russian independent news site Mediazona -- which was labeled a \"foreign agent\" last year by Russian authorities -- has documented 5,185 military deaths, based on local news reports and social media posts.",
            "The country's relatively well-off middle classes have likely been insulated from the war's toll. Many of those killed in action are from poorer regions of Russia; the regions with the highest numbers of documented casualties are so-called \"ethnic republics\" of Dagestan and Buryatia, Mediazona found. By contrast, casualties from Russia's two wealthiest and most populous cities -- Moscow and St. Petersburg -- have been relatively low, it reported.",
            "Putin's popularity is sometimes chalked up to a climate of fear and conformity. According to OVD-Info, an independent group that tracks detentions in Russia, 16,380 people have been arrested or detained for anti-war activism in Russia, and 75 criminal cases have been opened under Russia's \"fake news\" law.",
            "Unsurprisingly, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has revived discussion among scholars about whether or not Putin's regime should be labeled as fascist. That may seem largely a question of taxonomy, but it points to a clear reality: After February 24, terms such as \"autocratic\" or \"authoritarian\" are inadequate to describe a state that tolerates no internal dissent.",
            "Will public opinion turn?",
            "That said, some observers wonder how long Putin can count on the support of broad segments of the Russian public amid harsh international sanctions that have isolated Russia from the global economy and drastically cut the supply of imports. Western investment has largely fled the country. Sectors of the economy such as aviation, which have long depended on aircraft manufactured in the US or Europe, have been hard hit.",
            "As CNN's Clare Sebastian recently noted, Putin and his technocrats have worked for years to sanction-proof the Russian economy, through import substitution -- developing homegrown replacements for imported goods -- and developing a payments system to avoid financial isolation.",
            "And Russia has spun the awkward rebranding of McDonalds and Starbucks into tales of economic resilience.",
            "But a recent study by the Chief Executive Leadership Institute of the Yale School of Management paints a more dire picture.",
            "The study's authors argue that Russia does not have the infrastructure to simply pivot energy exports such as natural gas to Asia; Russian manufacturers lack parts from international suppliers; and that Russia's official statistics are papering over the depth of Russia's economic retreat.",
            "\"Despite Putin's delusions of self-sufficiency and import substitution, Russian domestic production has come to a complete standstill with no capacity to replace lost businesses, products and talent,\" the report says. \"The hollowing out of Russia's domestic innovation and production base has led to soaring prices and consumer angst.\"",
            "Still, Russia's financial system has not collapsed, and consumer anxiety has not translated into political unrest. For Ukraine and its supporters, the conversation has now shifted to finding ways to inflict pain on Russians for their passive support of Putin.",
            "\"We are working on new sanctions against Russia and on stimulating the citizens of the terrorist state to feel their share of responsibility for what is happening,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a recent address. \"The discussion about visa restrictions in Europe for holders of Russian passports is expanding every day, new states and new politicians are joining it.\"",
            "It's unclear if a visa ban would ultimately change Russian behavior. Some European leaders -- most notably, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz -- have been reluctant to endorse a ban. Speaking at a recent press conference in Oslo, Scholz told reporters that leaders had to be \"very clear\" on the visa ban issue as the actions in Ukraine are \"Putin's war\" and \"not the war of the Russian people.\"",
            "And while Putin may be the decider, to borrow a George W. Bushism, there is also a collective Putin that supports him and helps realize his policies. Whatever economic consequences they face from sanctions, Putin's loyal oligarchs have not broken ranks.",
            "\"Putin's war with Ukraine has been going on for 6 months now,\" wrote imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny in what he called a \"rage thread\" from behind bars. \"From Day 1, Western leaders firmly stated that Putin's oligarchs and bribe-takers would face imminent sanctions and wouldn't get away this time. But they did.\"",
            "It's a dismal picture, and one that suggests that Putin -- who has survived snubbing by world leaders before -- is willing to play a long game here. He may perhaps be counting on the fact that, over the next six months, Europeans will be paying higher prices for energy, potentially raising the pressure on governments to push Ukraine to submit to a peace deal. Winter may be coming, but Ukrainians are also fighting for their national survival."

            "\"Our findings show that despite the numerous introductions across Australia, it was a single batch of English rabbits that triggered this devastating biological invasion -- the effects of which are still being felt today,\" said lead author Joel Alves, also a researcher at the University of Oxford.",
            "\"That single event triggered this enormous catastrophe in Australia; the fastest colonization rate for an introduced mammal ever recorded.\"",
            "While Austin was not the first person to introduce rabbits to Australia -- five of the animals had been aboard the First Fleet of British ships that reached Sydney in 1788 and at least 90 more importations were made over the next 70 years -- it was the descendants of his 24 rabbits that would come to dominate the continent, the study said.",
            "And it concluded that nearly all of Australia's 200 million wild rabbits can be traced to that fateful shipment he received in 1859.",
            "\"Environmental change may have made Australia vulnerable to invasion,\" researchers said. \"But it was the genetic makeup of a small batch of wild rabbits that ignited one of the most iconic biological invasions of all time.\"",
            "The researchers also studied how the population of rabbits had managed to survive and thrive in Australia's harsh wilderness.",
            "Genetic analysis revealed that unlike earlier Australian rabbits, which displayed domesticated traits like \"tameness, floppy ears and fancy colored fur,\" rabbits descended from Austin's brood had a large amount of wild ancestry.",
            "\"If animals are bred for domestication, one of the things they lack is anti-predator behavior, (which) is both learned and also evolved,\" said study co-author Mike Letnic of the University of New South Wales.",
            "Rabbit plagues have occurred several times throughout parts of Australia for decades. The continent is still struggling with its wild rabbit population today.",
            "The report, its researchers said, showed the importance of maintaining strict biosecurity in Australia.",
            "\"These findings matter because biological invasions are a major threat to global biodiversity and if you want to prevent them you need to understand what makes them succeed,\" researchers said.",
            "\"The (event) serves as a reminder that the actions of just one person, or a few people, can have a devastating environmental impact.\""

Putin's rise on New Year's Eve, 1999, ushered in a new social contract: Russia would see an end to its criminal lawlessness, and in exchange, Russians accepted a form of authoritarian rule. The bandits no longer ruled Russia \u2014 Putin's security services did. That didn't mean that assassinations were no longer a feature of Russia's political landscape: It's just that they were typically carried out against those who challenged Putin's authority.",

            "To date, he has identified around 30 new species -- from a purple fairy wrasse named after the mythical nation of Wakanda, to the Tosanoides aphrodite, a pink and yellow reef fish named after the Greek goddess of love. But his deep-sea explorations have also proven that these reefs and the rainbow-hued species that roam them are under threat. His mission is to protect them.",
            "Diving in",
            "Entering the twilight zone is no easy feat. While it could be reached by submarine, this would be a clumsy way to study fish that flit in and out the shadows, says Rocha, comparing it to studying birds in a rainforest with a helicopter.",
            "Instead he scuba dives, but the deeper he descends the more dangerous it becomes. Recreational diving is capped at 130 feet for safety reasons, but Rocha dives as far as 500 feet. To do this requires deep concentration, intense technical training and a strong dose of bravery.",
            "\"What really makes this research special is that there's only a handful of scientists in the world doing this,\" he says.",
            "Rocha usually dives in a group with two scientists and one safety officer. They spend hours preparing the kit, ensuring every piece of equipment is functioning well and that they are equipped to deal with underwater emergencies. The divers must use rebreathers, which recycle the gas exhaled by the diver, and a special breathing gas containing helium that is safe for deep dives.",
            "Getting down takes just 10 to 15 minutes depending on how steep the reef is, says Rocha, but the ascent can take five to six hours to allow the body to decompress.",
            "All that effort gives him just seven to 10 minutes at maximum depth, where he and his team look for fish, collect DNA samples and record the number of organisms in an area. If they think they have found a new species, they usually catch it and carry it up to the surface in a decompression chamber so they can study the specimen back in the lab.",
            "Related: Ocean photographer Shawn Heinrichs wants to save the seas",
            "Despite having done it dozens of times, Rocha still feels the pangs of anxiety before each dive. The deeper you go, the darker and colder the water gets, he says. \"But when we get there, we know why we're there. When you see something that nobody has ever seen before ... it's absolutely amazing.\"",
            "Human impacts run deep",
            "While the twilight zone has been explored by very few people, the effects of human activity are still apparent.",
            "Previously it was thought that coral reefs in deeper waters could provide a refuge as they are less affected by human development and climate change. But Rocha proved this wrong: \"One of our first discoveries is that those deeper reefs are really not a refuge for shallow reef organisms. They are almost as impacted as the shallow reefs are,\" he says.",
            "He has found plastic trash and fishing gear in some of the deepest reefs and has observed the impact of overfishing and climate change. While there is not yet enough data to determine the scale of the damage compared to shallow reefs, he says it is clear that water temperatures are warming in the deeper zones too and causing reefs to bleach.",
            "Rocha hopes that his research can help to educate people about the twilight zone and inspire action to protect it. He works with policymakers, making the case for marine protected areas where these deep reefs lie. In 2019, the Hope for Reefs initiative was involved in the protection of a coral reef habitat on Maricaban Island in the Philippines, and the year before their research informed the establishment of two protected areas in Brazil.",
            "Related: A shark 'superhighway' is being protected by fishermen",
            "Rocha also works closely with local communities, collaborating with local researchers and giving local names to newly discovered species. For instance, earlier this year he and Maldivian biologist Ahmed Najeeb discovered a rainbow-colored fish which they named Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa or rose-veiled fairy wrasse, after the national flower of the Maldives, a pink rose called Finifenmaa. Rocha hopes this will \"give ownership to the local people.\"",
            "Rocha believes that technology will soon advance to a point that gives many more people access to the twilight zone and even more species will be discovered. But his main goal is that when they do, the ecosystems will look the same as they do now.",
            "\"I don't think it's enough just to do the science,\" he says. \"We take many, many photographs ... and we bring those stories back up to the surface and we share it with as many people as possible.\"",
            "\"For the most part, when people realize that those reefs are there, they move towards protecting them,\" he adds."
